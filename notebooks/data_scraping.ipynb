If you intend to min/max school be prepared for an incredibly competitive environment. I’m talking about kids who get 1580 on the SAT and consider themselves average.\\n\\nBy the way, going to Paly DECREASES you chances of getting into many colleges because it is so much harder to stand out.', 'Very safe.  More sporty than Gunn.  Certain cliques have tons of academic pressure to thrive.  Important to have good balance to avoid burnout', 'lol is it safe? Yes it’s safe. Lots of hella rich kids and pressure to succeed at a high level. Decent at sports, namely football and basketball but sometimes baseball too. Jeremy Lin (nba basketballer) and joc pederson (mlb) both went there. So did James Franco for whatever that’s worth. \\n\\nHas good arts and theatre, I stayed doing that when I went there. They have a glass blowing studio!! \\n\\nAlso has a history of suicides often from parents putting too much pressure on theirs kids. If you have chill parents it can be a good time, if you are going to be pressured to go to an Ivy League or else be prepared for 4 years of stress. It ranks as one of the best public schools in California year after year, and despite two friends killing themselves while there I had mostly a good time', 'Richer and more old money than Gunn. A bit more of a party school. Good sports. Great school']"
