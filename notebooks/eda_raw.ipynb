         "[[\"Quote from another comment on this topic from a year ago:\\n > Zhong went to Gunn High School, an affluent top-performing school in Palo Alto, which is filled with high achieving kids, many of them will follow their parents's footsteps into tech jobs, and they're all vying for spots at many of the same top schools. Such high achieving classmates put Zhong about top 9% in a class of 485, and his high SAT score was likely not singular at Gunn, which means there might had been as many as 40 people at his high school with better academic numbers than him vying for spots at the same schools he was shooting for. High selective colleges in general, and highly competitive programs like computer science, don't want to have a bunch of kids from one particular high school in their freshman classes. So realistically there may have been one or two opportunities for Gunn Class of '23 grads who wanted to major in computer science at any one of the schools Zhong applied to, and there were other Gunn graduates more competitive than him.\\n\\n> Much has been made of young Stanley Zhong's big differentiator of founding a startup, how amazing it is for a teenager to do that. Stanley's father, Nan Zhong, is a Software Engineering Manager at Google. Previously he co-founded two startups, created the #1 ranked communication app on Android (featured by Fortune and Amazing Android Apps for Dummies), and raised $10M in venture funding. Before that, he led the team that built AWS's Elastic Load Balancing service. The Varsity Blues admissions scandal looms large in the minds of admissions officers at highly selective schools. If I were an admissions counselor with Zhong's application in front of me, the startup founder claim would pop, and a healthy skepticism of such a remarkable claim would have me doing some googling where I would find his father's profile, and immediately be suspicious about how much this startup was actually Stanley's doing vs his father's, to be honest.\\n\\nTotally get his frustrations, but with this context, there's a very reasonable possibility that there was a reason what happened to him happened.\\n\\nAlso, note that he ended up at Texas U&M, which is still a stellar school. The 18 schools he applied to clearly consisted of mostly Ivys and top schools, and he didn't just get rejected from all of the CSUs or something.\"], ['Does he have conclusive evidence that it was racial discrimination? Going from ‘I have impressive accomplishments but didn’t get in’ to ‘it was racial discrimination’ is a logical leap.

The number of nationwide high school valedictorians per year is far greater than the number of spots per year in many colleges — and that’s just the valedictorians, let alone everyone else with impressive accomplishments.\\n\\nA while ago a Yale admissions officer stated on a podcast something that’s stuck with me: **deciding who to admit to a selective college is not about who ‘deserves it’ the most or even who is the ‘best’. It’s about selecting a cohort of people for a very specific four-year experience.** No amount of accomplishments can definitively put someone into that cohort. If there actually was racial discrimination, this point is moot, but I’m just saying that pointing out one’s accomplishments is irrelevant.'], ['He only got into UT and U Maryland, what’re the odds he just had atrocious applications?'], ['Racial discrimination…?

         "[\"Quote from another comment on this topic from a year ago:\\n > Zhong went to Gunn High School, an affluent top-performing school in Palo Alto, which is filled with high achieving kids, many of them will follow their parents's footsteps into tech jobs, and they're all vying for spots at many of the same top schools. Such high achieving classmates put Zhong about top 9% in a class of 485, and his high SAT score was likely not singular at Gunn, which means there might had been as many as 40 people at his high school with better academic numbers than him vying for spots at the same schools he was shooting for. High selective colleges in general, and highly competitive programs like computer science, don't want to have a bunch of kids from one particular high school in their freshman classes. So realistically there may have been one or two opportunities for Gunn Class of '23 grads who wanted to major in computer science at any one of the schools Zhong applied to, and there were other Gunn graduates more competitive than him.\\n\\n> Much has been made of young Stanley Zhong's big differentiator of founding a startup, how amazing it is for a teenager to do that. Stanley's father, Nan Zhong, is a Software Engineering Manager at Google. Previously he co-founded two startups, created the #1 ranked communication app on Android (featured by Fortune and Amazing Android Apps for Dummies), and raised $10M in venture funding. Before that, he led the team that built AWS's Elastic Load Balancing service. The Varsity Blues admissions scandal looms large in the minds of admissions officers at highly selective schools. If I were an admissions counselor with Zhong's application in front of me, the startup founder claim would pop, and a healthy skepticism of such a remarkable claim would have me doing some googling where I would find his father's profile, and immediately be suspicious about how much this startup was actually Stanley's doing vs his father's, to be honest.\\n\\nTotally get his frustrations, but with this context, there's a very reasonable possibility that there was a reason what happened to him happened.\\n\\nAlso, note that he ended up at Texas U&M, which is still a stellar school.

I\\'m mexican and am 72% Euro, 25% indigenous, and 3% black, yet I don\\'t think I\\'m seen as white almost anywhere I\\'ve been in the US (in the Southwest probably everyone identifies me as mexican, and in Michigan most thought I was middle eastern). And this applies to many \"white\" hispanics that have darker features and some mediterranean europeans as well', \"Yeah people don't realize that Spain is European. The Spaniards that conquered were light skinned, light brown/green eyed Europeans. I'm half Puerto Rican, 1/4 Mexican, 1/4 Sicilian and people think I look like I'm from India?

Boston is a melting pot and Springfield has as many Latinos as Albuquerque.', \"In the early 90's I used to help my Uncle during harvest on his vineyard/orchard in eastern Washington state. There were 15 migrant workers there, all Mexican and all documented with work permits. They were given on site housing and food on top of wages which worked out to 8-10 bucks an hour based on production, not bad for a lot of folks those days, McDonald's was probably paying 3-4 an hour then, with no housing and garbage food. Those guys were great and well practiced after working up the California coast initially. The only problem ever was the one guy I always found passed out in the vines everyday. The crew foreman was personally responsible for him, I never found out why, but my Uncle told me to let it go.

I think the issue was a lot of Hispanic people identifying primarily as Hispanic, but then having to pick another “race” as well—which might be obvious for a Black Dominican, but not necessarily for the average person from Mexico whose heritage blends Spanish and indigenous groups. So people were kind of arbitrarily picking white, Native, other, etc., which wasn’t helpful statistically.', '\"Race\" is stupid and arbitrary to begin with.

That\\'s why the form is changing in 2030.', 'It\\'s pretty variable, with many choosing \"other\" or \"two or more.\"\\n\\nTo the Census Bureau\\'s credit, Hispanic is not a racial distinction at all, but a linguistic and cultural one that includes people with primarily African, primarily indigenous American, and primarily European ancestries, as well as any combination of these. Sammy Sosa and Martin Sheen are both Hispanic, yet have very different ancestries.\\n\\nIn the U.S., however, many people talk about race in a simple way as white-black-Hispanic-Asian, where Native ancestry gets ignored and Hispanic is basically a placeholder for the average Central American person\\'s mix of ancestors from Europe and the Americas, AKA mestizo. This system fails to capture lots of people, from those with 100% European Spanish ancestry to Afro-Caribbean Spanish speakers. (This is also where the Census Bureau would include Middle Eastern and North African people in the same category as Europeans, which is genetically and historically very reasonable but doesn\\'t gel with American conceptualizations of whiteness.)\\n\\nAdmittedly, the Bureau doesn\\'t give a great option for mestizo ancestry, as American Indian or Alaska Native is defined as \"A person having origins in any of the original peoples of North and South America (including Central America) and who maintains tribal affiliation or community attachment.\" Many recent Mexican immigrants have substantial indigenous ancestry but no tribal affiliation or community attachment, and don\\'t identify strongly with European roots either.\\n\\nUltimately, race is 100% self-identified on the census.', 'No not at all, most of the Hispanic community in Roswell New Mexico which is the link I provided are fairly dark-skinned.
