         "[['current paly student here! paly is pretty safe, yeah some kids do drugs and drink but it\\'s mainly off campus and the worst it gets is vaping in the bathrooms from what I hear, but I\\'ve never personally witnessed much of it myself. there are of course always weirdos and stalkers, but they\\'re pretty rare so you shouldn\\'t be too concerned about your safety.\\n\\nsocially, paly is very focused on academics. of course, not everyone is, but the majority of students are going to care more about their schoolwork/specialization (journalism, sports, etc) than almost everything else. the lack of school spirit is actually impressive, no one really shows up to events like performances or sports games, other than major football games and theatre performances. the culture here is very cutthroat, it\\'s very competetive, and due to the nature of being in a pressure cooker school where everyone\\'s fighting to get into good schools its very easy to feel isolated and that relations are lacking. it\\'s also very cliquey, whether people here will admit it or not. it\\'s hard to notice but in my opinion, most friend groups here are echo chambers. not neccesarily a bad thing, but also means it\\'s extra important to find yourself with a good group of people because it can feel extremely hard trying to restart your social life here. there\\'s so many people at paly but in a way it makes it feel even easier to become a loner. the best way to make friends outside of class is to join some type of extracurricular (robotics, theatre, sports, journalism, etc) or a club! the school programs here are very highly regarded and 99% of clubs will be very welcoming and excited to have new people.\\n\\nacademics here are tough, comparable to private school. there will always be someone better than you, this is a fact. honestly, don\\'t beat yourself up over it, don\\'t stress too hard, the average paly student is smarter than 95% of the country. there\\'s alot of talk about mental health, it\\'s really normalized here to be depressed and ignore it but please, do take care of yourself. lets be so fr getting a B or even a C on the test isn\\'t the end of the world, everything in life is temporary.\\n\\nside note - lunch time\\npaly is across the street from town and country which is basically just a shopping center, and we have an open campus policy which basically means if you\\'re not in class, technically you\\'re allowed to leave whenever you want to go buy food or just chill. maybe you\\'ve realized by now but Palo alto is fucking expensive. average lunch there is gonna be at least $12. budget wisely if you are given money and try not to go broke! and also try not to be tardy, if you\\'re tardy enough they make you go to \"tardy intervention\" which from what I hear is just them lecturing at you for an hour straight to be better\\n\\nfor advice, honestly I\\'d say as a freshman just focus on finding community. freshman classes are easy as fuck, especially with the fact they\\'re removing bioH as an option, the only class that most people could find challenging would be geoH, which in my opinion is very doable--but I\\'m also the kid who doesn\\'t study and get good grades so maybe don\\'t listen to me about that part lol. but seriously, don\\'t stress, and just take your time adjusting. there are 2 different middle schools that feed into paly + there\\'s usually some private school kids and we\\'re all pretty used to immigrants and meeting new people, so don\\'t be scared\\n\\nI can\\'t think of anything else to add, but lmk if you have questions! \\nthere\\'s also a paly discord server if you\\'re interested, but that server is currently a mess and I cannot in good concious tell you to join it (even though that\\'s where I found this from lol) but if you\\'re interested I\\'ll drop/dm a link'], ['It is a school where extremely nerdy kids who care a lot about doing well in school make up a significant part of the class. \\n\\nAt the same time there is a thriving performing arts program and the art studios and athletic departments have great well funded facilities.\\n\\nSo, if you DON’T want to min/max school you will be happy. If you intend to min/max school be prepared for an incredibly competitive environment. I’m talking about kids who get 1580 on the SAT and consider themselves average.\\n\\nBy the way, going to Paly DECREASES you chances of getting into many colleges because it is so much harder to stand out.'], ['Very safe.  More sporty than Gunn.  Certain cliques have tons of academic pressure to thrive.  Important to have good balance to avoid burnout'], ['lol is it safe? Yes it’s safe. Lots of hella rich kids and pressure to succeed at a high level. Decent at sports, namely football and basketball but sometimes baseball too. Jeremy Lin (nba basketballer) and joc pederson (mlb) both went there. So did James Franco for whatever that’s worth. \\n\\nHas good arts and theatre, I stayed doing that when I went there. They have a glass blowing studio!! \\n\\nAlso has a history of suicides often from parents putting too much pressure on theirs kids. If you have chill parents it can be a good time, if you are going to be pressured to go to an Ivy League or else be prepared for 4 years of stress. It ranks as one of the best public schools in California year after year, and despite two friends killing themselves while there I had mostly a good time'], ['Richer and more old money than Gunn. A bit more of a party school. Good sports. Great school'], ['It depends on what you mean by safe. There is virtually no crime in that area but the suicide rate is genuinely terrifying.'], ['The main “safety” issue is the amount of pressure kids feel to be perfect academically. It is competitive to an unhealthy level.'], ['Paly is what you make of it! I see in your other replies that your not from the US so if I were you I’d sit down and figure out what your post-HS plans are because it can help guide what you do at Paly (ie min/maxing your schedule as others have said). Definitely join a sport! I’d also recommend doing journalism as it’s REALLY big at Paly and it’s one thing I regret not doing.
