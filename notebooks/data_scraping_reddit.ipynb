         "Bay Area teen rejected by 16 colleges, hired by Google files racial discrimination lawsuit",
         "[[\"Quote from another comment on this topic from a year ago:\\n > Zhong went to Gunn High School, an affluent top-performing school in Palo Alto, which is filled with high achieving kids, many of them will follow their parents's footsteps into tech jobs, and they're all vying for spots at many of the same top schools. Such high achieving classmates put Zhong about top 9% in a class of 485, and his high SAT score was likely not singular at Gunn, which means there might had been as many as 40 people at his high school with better academic numbers than him vying for spots at the same schools he was shooting for. High selective colleges in general, and highly competitive programs like computer science, don't want to have a bunch of kids from one particular high school in their freshman classes. So realistically there may have been one or two opportunities for Gunn Class of '23 grads who wanted to major in computer science at any one of the schools Zhong applied to, and there were other Gunn graduates more competitive than him.\\n\\n> Much has been made of young Stanley Zhong's big differentiator of founding a startup, how amazing it is for a teenager to do that. Stanley's father, Nan Zhong, is a Software Engineering Manager at Google. Previously he co-founded two startups, created the #1 ranked communication app on Android (featured by Fortune and Amazing Android Apps for Dummies), and raised $10M in venture funding. Before that, he led the team that built AWS's Elastic Load Balancing service. The Varsity Blues admissions scandal looms large in the minds of admissions officers at highly selective schools. If I were an admissions counselor with Zhong's application in front of me, the startup founder claim would pop, and a healthy skepticism of such a remarkable claim would have me doing some googling where I would find his father's profile, and immediately be suspicious about how much this startup was actually Stanley's doing vs his father's, to be honest.\\n\\nTotally get his frustrations, but with this context, there's a very reasonable possibility that there was a reason what happened to him happened.\\n\\nAlso, note that he ended up at Texas U&M, which is still a stellar school.

Going from ‘I have impressive accomplishments but didn’t get in’ to ‘it was racial discrimination’ is a logical leap. I had some similar stats when I applied to undergrad and got rejected from most places I applied to (even after spending months on my essays). The number of nationwide high school valedictorians per year is far greater than the number of spots per year in many colleges — and that’s just the valedictorians, let alone everyone else with impressive accomplishments.\\n\\nA while ago a Yale admissions officer stated on a podcast something that’s stuck with me: **deciding who to admit to a selective college is not about who ‘deserves it’ the most or even who is the ‘best’. It’s about selecting a cohort of people for a very specific four-year experience.** No amount of accomplishments can definitively put someone into that cohort. If there actually was racial discrimination, this point is moot, but I’m just saying that pointing out one’s accomplishments is irrelevant.'], ['He only got into UT and U Maryland, what’re the odds he just had atrocious applications?'], ['Racial discrimination…?

As someone who works at a community college who has attended how they review applications, the process is as fair as a process can be and race isn’t even shown on the applicants and the officers would only know if it was mentioned in the PIQ’s. I do not believe in only using test scores as testing is also very flawed (and wealthier applicants will be incentived to just cheat to get higher test scores, which many already do) - testing is also not non-discriminatory and many studies have shown that testing has bias. Majority of applicants to UC’s have similar applications - they will outright reject an application that has a PIQ response that doesn’t answer the question and thought it was funny to say something silly or give a one sentence response.

If yes, then they are qualified.  The only correction factor needed is to offset for income disparity, not race, ethnicity, legacy, donor, etc.  Why is this?   We know the wealthy have greater access to educational resources.  This is a result of unequal financing of elementary and high schools based on property taxes, resulting in unequal spending and unequal treatment, a fundamental violation of democratic principles.  In short, those who are qualified based on adjusted criteria, should then be admitted by simple random draw.  This is the only fair and equitable way.

         "[\"Quote from another comment on this topic from a year ago:\\n > Zhong went to Gunn High School, an affluent top-performing school in Palo Alto, which is filled with high achieving kids, many of them will follow their parents's footsteps into tech jobs, and they're all vying for spots at many of the same top schools. Such high achieving classmates put Zhong about top 9% in a class of 485, and his high SAT score was likely not singular at Gunn, which means there might had been as many as 40 people at his high school with better academic numbers than him vying for spots at the same schools he was shooting for. High selective colleges in general, and highly competitive programs like computer science, don't want to have a bunch of kids from one particular high school in their freshman classes. So realistically there may have been one or two opportunities for Gunn Class of '23 grads who wanted to major in computer science at any one of the schools Zhong applied to, and there were other Gunn graduates more competitive than him.\\n\\n> Much has been made of young Stanley Zhong's big differentiator of founding a startup, how amazing it is for a teenager to do that. Stanley's father, Nan Zhong, is a Software Engineering Manager at Google. Previously he co-founded two startups, created the #1 ranked communication app on Android (featured by Fortune and Amazing Android Apps for Dummies), and raised $10M in venture funding. Before that, he led the team that built AWS's Elastic Load Balancing service. The Varsity Blues admissions scandal looms large in the minds of admissions officers at highly selective schools. If I were an admissions counselor with Zhong's application in front of me, the startup founder claim would pop, and a healthy skepticism of such a remarkable claim would have me doing some googling where I would find his father's profile, and immediately be suspicious about how much this startup was actually Stanley's doing vs his father's, to be honest.\\n\\nTotally get his frustrations, but with this context, there's a very reasonable possibility that there was a reason what happened to him happened.\\n\\nAlso, note that he ended up at Texas U&M, which is still a stellar school.

         "[[\"Quote from another comment on this topic from a year ago:\\n > Zhong went to Gunn High School, an affluent top-performing school in Palo Alto, which is filled with high achieving kids, many of them will follow their parents's footsteps into tech jobs, and they're all vying for spots at many of the same top schools. Such high achieving classmates put Zhong about top 9% in a class of 485, and his high SAT score was likely not singular at Gunn, which means there might had been as many as 40 people at his high school with better academic numbers than him vying for spots at the same schools he was shooting for. High selective colleges in general, and highly competitive programs like computer science, don't want to have a bunch of kids from one particular high school in their freshman classes. So realistically there may have been one or two opportunities for Gunn Class of '23 grads who wanted to major in computer science at any one of the schools Zhong applied to, and there were other Gunn graduates more competitive than him.\\n\\n> Much has been made of young Stanley Zhong's big differentiator of founding a startup, how amazing it is for a teenager to do that. Stanley's father, Nan Zhong, is a Software Engineering Manager at Google. Previously he co-founded two startups, created the #1 ranked communication app on Android (featured by Fortune and Amazing Android Apps for Dummies), and raised $10M in venture funding. Before that, he led the team that built AWS's Elastic Load Balancing service. The Varsity Blues admissions scandal looms large in the minds of admissions officers at highly selective schools. If I were an admissions counselor with Zhong's application in front of me, the startup founder claim would pop, and a healthy skepticism of such a remarkable claim would have me doing some googling where I would find his father's profile, and immediately be suspicious about how much this startup was actually Stanley's doing vs his father's, to be honest.\\n\\nTotally get his frustrations, but with this context, there's a very reasonable possibility that there was a reason what happened to him happened.\\n\\nAlso, note that he ended up at Texas U&M, which is still a stellar school. The 18 schools he applied to clearly consisted of mostly Ivys and top schools, and he didn't just get rejected from all of the CSUs or something.\"], ['Does he have conclusive evidence that it was racial discrimination? Going from ‘I have impressive accomplishments but didn’t get in’ to ‘it was racial discrimination’ is a logical leap. I had some similar stats when I applied to undergrad and got rejected from most places I applied to (even after spending months on my essays). The number of nationwide high school valedictorians per year is far greater than the number of spots per year in many colleges — and that’s just the valedictorians, let alone everyone else with impressive accomplishments.\\n\\nA while ago a Yale admissions officer stated on a podcast something that’s stuck with me: **deciding who to admit to a selective college is not about who ‘deserves it’ the most or even who is the ‘best’. It’s about selecting a cohort of people for a very specific four-year experience.** No amount of accomplishments can definitively put someone into that cohort. If there actually was racial discrimination, this point is moot, but I’m just saying that pointing out one’s accomplishments is irrelevant.'], ['He only got into UT and U Maryland, what’re the odds he just had atrocious applications?'], ['Racial discrimination…?

I do not believe in only using test scores as testing is also very flawed (and wealthier applicants will be incentived to just cheat to get higher test scores, which many already do) - testing is also not non-discriminatory and many studies have shown that testing has bias. Majority of applicants to UC’s have similar applications - they will outright reject an application that has a PIQ response that doesn’t answer the question and thought it was funny to say something silly or give a one sentence response.

If yes, then they are qualified.  The only correction factor needed is to offset for income disparity, not race, ethnicity, legacy, donor, etc.  Why is this?   We know the wealthy have greater access to educational resources.  This is a result of unequal financing of elementary and high schools based on property taxes, resulting in unequal spending and unequal treatment, a fundamental violation of democratic principles.  In short, those who are qualified based on adjusted criteria, should then be admitted by simple random draw.  This is the only fair and equitable way.

         "[\"Quote from another comment on this topic from a year ago:\\n > Zhong went to Gunn High School, an affluent top-performing school in Palo Alto, which is filled with high achieving kids, many of them will follow their parents's footsteps into tech jobs, and they're all vying for spots at many of the same top schools. Such high achieving classmates put Zhong about top 9% in a class of 485, and his high SAT score was likely not singular at Gunn, which means there might had been as many as 40 people at his high school with better academic numbers than him vying for spots at the same schools he was shooting for. High selective colleges in general, and highly competitive programs like computer science, don't want to have a bunch of kids from one particular high school in their freshman classes. So realistically there may have been one or two opportunities for Gunn Class of '23 grads who wanted to major in computer science at any one of the schools Zhong applied to, and there were other Gunn graduates more competitive than him.\\n\\n> Much has been made of young Stanley Zhong's big differentiator of founding a startup, how amazing it is for a teenager to do that. Stanley's father, Nan Zhong, is a Software Engineering Manager at Google. Previously he co-founded two startups, created the #1 ranked communication app on Android (featured by Fortune and Amazing Android Apps for Dummies), and raised $10M in venture funding. Before that, he led the team that built AWS's Elastic Load Balancing service. The Varsity Blues admissions scandal looms large in the minds of admissions officers at highly selective schools. If I were an admissions counselor with Zhong's application in front of me, the startup founder claim would pop, and a healthy skepticism of such a remarkable claim would have me doing some googling where I would find his father's profile, and immediately be suspicious about how much this startup was actually Stanley's doing vs his father's, to be honest.\\n\\nTotally get his frustrations, but with this context, there's a very reasonable possibility that there was a reason what happened to him happened.\\n\\nAlso, note that he ended up at Texas U&M, which is still a stellar school.

Meanwhile, they complain that my brother doesn’t bring his kids around often.', 'For real, my parents have always told me I have a home at home. Had to move back home once cause I separated from a 4 year relationship. I don’t live at home atm, but if I had to could return. Definitely going be way nicer about their needs as they age and become elderly. They don’t believe I have to support them in old age either, but I’m not going to let anything crazy drag them down since the economy isn’t promised to be good when they fully retire in the next 10 years.', 'In the current financial climate we find ourselves in, it seems like an unnecessarily cruel punishment for his poor bloody kids. He needs to remember, how he sends them out into this world will directly correlate to their choices and ability to care for and about him when it’s time for them to choose his nursing home', 'Well the cat’s in the cradle and the silver spoon', \">Eh, dads like that don’t actually want you to call and aren’t really interested in your life anyways.\\n\\nUnfortunately this is true. Some won't ever wonder why you never called.\", 'Correct.   I don’t know my bio father but my step douche was a total asshole to me, had a huge problem with myself preferring dick over vagina, so so so many things I could share about them lol.  Anyway he hated me, would kick me out of the house and lock the door until my mother got home from work and pretend he didn’t do it, a lot of stuff like that and no my “mother” didn’t do anything or care either.  Was too busy with her other child captain morgan.   \\n\\nAnyway when he had his first heart attack, he eats/ate horrible polish food / bad shit in general, he all of a sudden wanted to talk to me and hang out.  \\n\\nSorry.. but no.   You made my life hell, I hope your end is beyond that suffering.  Is it mean?  I don’t know.', \"Were I in your position, I would not regret that decision in the slightest. They're terrible people for actively profiting from children that they brought into the world. That's like having children in order to sell them into slavery, except you had to see their profiteering mugs every day as they ate food you paid for. I hate what humans will do to other humans.\", \"For what it's worth from a stranger, I'm proud of you. Addiction is a vicious beast that has ruined countless lives. I hope your recovery continues to go well and you find peace.\", 'Same and same! Here we are almost 4 years congrats!!', 'Congratulations on your sobriety im proud of you! Have a cookie', 'Yes now in my 30s… I feel extremely proud and traumatized I survived living on my own so young. I also deal with and struggle with alot of anger at my family. I love them but I just hate they did me this way.', \"I remember at one point my starter on my extremely shitty car went out but I didn't have money for a new one. I figured out that if I parked at this one part of the parking lot at one of my shit jobs that I could get the car rolling enough to pop the clutch when I left work. I had to do that for a week until I could get it fixed, and then I had to be cheap and eat Ramen for a while to make up for the expense.\\n\\n\\nThere's no reason it had to be like that. Some of my step siblings lived with my parents like ten years longer than me and got all kinds of help, but they also didn't get treated like shit like my siblings and I did.\\n\\n\\nIf I had the chance to go back and do it again, I would do the same thing, but my parent admitted they would have done it much differently. Too late now.\", \"I mean it. Look after yourself out there and be the best person you can for your daughter! Don't let more people become broken due to a lack of support or care.\\nI've been down some similar paths 🥰\", \"Thank you all! I definitely couldn't of done it without family support!\"]",

         "Bay Area teen rejected by 16 colleges, hired by Google files racial discrimination lawsuit",
         "[[\"Quote from another comment on this topic from a year ago:\\n > Zhong went to Gunn High School, an affluent top-performing school in Palo Alto, which is filled with high achieving kids, many of them will follow their parents's footsteps into tech jobs, and they're all vying for spots at many of the same top schools. Such high achieving classmates put Zhong about top 9% in a class of 485, and his high SAT score was likely not singular at Gunn, which means there might had been as many as 40 people at his high school with better academic numbers than him vying for spots at the same schools he was shooting for. High selective colleges in general, and highly competitive programs like computer science, don't want to have a bunch of kids from one particular high school in their freshman classes. So realistically there may have been one or two opportunities for Gunn Class of '23 grads who wanted to major in computer science at any one of the schools Zhong applied to, and there were other Gunn graduates more competitive than him.\\n\\n> Much has been made of young Stanley Zhong's big differentiator of founding a startup, how amazing it is for a teenager to do that. Stanley's father, Nan Zhong, is a Software Engineering Manager at Google. Previously he co-founded two startups, created the #1 ranked communication app on Android (featured by Fortune and Amazing Android Apps for Dummies), and raised $10M in venture funding. Before that, he led the team that built AWS's Elastic Load Balancing service. The Varsity Blues admissions scandal looms large in the minds of admissions officers at highly selective schools. If I were an admissions counselor with Zhong's application in front of me, the startup founder claim would pop, and a healthy skepticism of such a remarkable claim would have me doing some googling where I would find his father's profile, and immediately be suspicious about how much this startup was actually Stanley's doing vs his father's, to be honest.\\n\\nTotally get his frustrations, but with this context, there's a very reasonable possibility that there was a reason what happened to him happened.\\n\\nAlso, note that he ended up at Texas U&M, which is still a stellar school. The 18 schools he applied to clearly consisted of mostly Ivys and top schools, and he didn't just get rejected from all of the CSUs or something.\"], ['Does he have conclusive evidence that it was racial discrimination? Going from ‘I have impressive accomplishments but didn’t get in’ to ‘it was racial discrimination’ is a logical leap. I had some similar stats when I applied to undergrad and got rejected from most places I applied to (even after spending months on my essays). The number of nationwide high school valedictorians per year is far greater than the number of spots per year in many colleges — and that’s just the valedictorians, let alone everyone else with impressive accomplishments.\\n\\nA while ago a Yale admissions officer stated on a podcast something that’s stuck with me: **deciding who to admit to a selective college is not about who ‘deserves it’ the most or even who is the ‘best’. It’s about selecting a cohort of people for a very specific four-year experience.** No amount of accomplishments can definitively put someone into that cohort. If there actually was racial discrimination, this point is moot, but I’m just saying that pointing out one’s accomplishments is irrelevant.'], ['He only got into UT and U Maryland, what’re the odds he just had atrocious applications?'], ['Racial discrimination…?

Stanley's father, Nan Zhong, is a Software Engineering Manager at Google. Previously he co-founded two startups, created the #1 ranked communication app on Android (featured by Fortune and Amazing Android Apps for Dummies), and raised $10M in venture funding. Before that, he led the team that built AWS's Elastic Load Balancing service. The Varsity Blues admissions scandal looms large in the minds of admissions officers at highly selective schools. If I were an admissions counselor with Zhong's application in front of me, the startup founder claim would pop, and a healthy skepticism of such a remarkable claim would have me doing some googling where I would find his father's profile, and immediately be suspicious about how much this startup was actually Stanley's doing vs his father's, to be honest.\\n\\nTotally get his frustrations, but with this context, there's a very reasonable possibility that there was a reason what happened to him happened.\\n\\nAlso, note that he ended up at Texas U&M, which is still a stellar school. The 18 schools he applied to clearly consisted of mostly Ivys and top schools, and he didn't just get rejected from all of the CSUs or something.\", 'Does he have conclusive evidence that it was racial discrimination? Going from ‘I have impressive accomplishments but didn’t get in’ to ‘it was racial discrimination’ is a logical leap. I had some similar stats when I applied to undergrad and got rejected from most places I applied to (even after spending months on my essays). The number of nationwide high school valedictorians per year is far greater than the number of spots per year in many colleges — and that’s just the valedictorians, let alone everyone else with impressive accomplishments.\\n\\nA while ago a Yale admissions officer stated on a podcast something that’s stuck with me: **deciding who to admit to a selective college is not about who ‘deserves it’ the most or even who is the ‘best’. It’s about selecting a cohort of people for a very specific four-year experience.** No amount of accomplishments can definitively put someone into that cohort.

I do not believe in only using test scores as testing is also very flawed (and wealthier applicants will be incentived to just cheat to get higher test scores, which many already do) - testing is also not non-discriminatory and many studies have shown that testing has bias. Majority of applicants to UC’s have similar applications - they will outright reject an application that has a PIQ response that doesn’t answer the question and thought it was funny to say something silly or give a one sentence response.

If yes, then they are qualified.  The only correction factor needed is to offset for income disparity, not race, ethnicity, legacy, donor, etc.  Why is this?   We know the wealthy have greater access to educational resources.  This is a result of unequal financing of elementary and high schools based on property taxes, resulting in unequal spending and unequal treatment, a fundamental violation of democratic principles.  In short, those who are qualified based on adjusted criteria, should then be admitted by simple random draw.  This is the only fair and equitable way.

         "['current paly student here! paly is pretty safe, yeah some kids do drugs and drink but it\\'s mainly off campus and the worst it gets is vaping in the bathrooms from what I hear, but I\\'ve never personally witnessed much of it myself. there are of course always weirdos and stalkers, but they\\'re pretty rare so you shouldn\\'t be too concerned about your safety.\\n\\nsocially, paly is very focused on academics. of course, not everyone is, but the majority of students are going to care more about their schoolwork/specialization (journalism, sports, etc) than almost everything else. the lack of school spirit is actually impressive, no one really shows up to events like performances or sports games, other than major football games and theatre performances. the culture here is very cutthroat, it\\'s very competetive, and due to the nature of being in a pressure cooker school where everyone\\'s fighting to get into good schools its very easy to feel isolated and that relations are lacking. it\\'s also very cliquey, whether people here will admit it or not. it\\'s hard to notice but in my opinion, most friend groups here are echo chambers. not neccesarily a bad thing, but also means it\\'s extra important to find yourself with a good group of people because it can feel extremely hard trying to restart your social life here. there\\'s so many people at paly but in a way it makes it feel even easier to become a loner. the best way to make friends outside of class is to join some type of extracurricular (robotics, theatre, sports, journalism, etc) or a club! the school programs here are very highly regarded and 99% of clubs will be very welcoming and excited to have new people.\\n\\nacademics here are tough, comparable to private school. there will always be someone better than you, this is a fact. honestly, don\\'t beat yourself up over it, don\\'t stress too hard, the average paly student is smarter than 95% of the country. there\\'s alot of talk about mental health, it\\'s really normalized here to be depressed and ignore it but please, do take care of yourself. lets be so fr getting a B or even a C on the test isn\\'t the end of the world, everything in life is temporary.\\n\\nside note - lunch time\\npaly is across the street from town and country which is basically just a shopping center, and we have an open campus policy which basically means if you\\'re not in class, technically you\\'re allowed to leave whenever you want to go buy food or just chill. maybe you\\'ve realized by now but Palo alto is fucking expensive. average lunch there is gonna be at least $12. budget wisely if you are given money and try not to go broke! and also try not to be tardy, if you\\'re tardy enough they make you go to \"tardy intervention\" which from what I hear is just them lecturing at you for an hour straight to be better\\n\\nfor advice, honestly I\\'d say as a freshman just focus on finding community. freshman classes are easy as fuck, especially with the fact they\\'re removing bioH as an option, the only class that most people could find challenging would be geoH, which in my opinion is very doable--but I\\'m also the kid who doesn\\'t study and get good grades so maybe don\\'t listen to me about that part lol. but seriously, don\\'t stress, and just take your time adjusting. there are 2 different middle schools that feed into paly + there\\'s usually some private school kids and we\\'re all pretty used to immigrants and meeting new people, so don\\'t be scared\\n\\nI can\\'t think of anything else to add, but lmk if you have questions! \\nthere\\'s also a paly discord server if you\\'re interested, but that server is currently a mess and I cannot in good concious tell you to join it (even though that\\'s where I found this from lol) but if you\\'re interested I\\'ll drop/dm a link', 'It is a school where extremely nerdy kids who care a lot about doing well in school make up a significant part of the class. \\n\\nAt the same time there is a thriving performing arts program and the art studios and athletic departments have great well funded facilities.\\n\\nSo, if you DON’T want to min/max school you will be happy. If you intend to min/max school be prepared for an incredibly competitive environment. I’m talking about kids who get 1580 on the SAT and consider themselves average.\\n\\nBy the way, going to Paly DECREASES you chances of getting into many colleges because it is so much harder to stand out.', 'Very safe.  More sporty than Gunn.  Certain cliques have tons of academic pressure to thrive.  Important to have good balance to avoid burnout', 'lol is it safe? Yes it’s safe.

Where does the money come from?  \\n\\nIf you aren\\'t taking tuition up-front how are you funding day-to-day operations?  \\nMy concern is if you will be around for students to complete their educations before you go belly-up (which I don\\'t hope happens at all, just a concern).  \\nYou built a brand new college in one of the most expensive cities in the US, if not the world and you\\'re doing it with a highly nebulous business model.  \\nAre you structured as a For-Profit institution?  \\n\\nYou mention that you have some quantity of scholarships even for international applicants.  \\nThere are only a few handfuls of US universities who offer scholarships to internationals, and they tend to be highly well-funded.  \\nHow can you afford that? Is your business model to become an H1B processing plant?  \\n\\nIt\\'s not my intention to attack your institution, but it feels almost purpose-built to serve as a perfect H1B factory.  \\nNo up-front tuition. Accelerated classes. Scholarships. Right smack in the heart of SanFran/SV.  \\nThe only thing missing is an Accelerated Masters Degree program.  \\n\\n>  An alternative provider like Make School could partner with an established University and create a new program offering degrees without going through a 3-5 year accreditation process.   \\n\\nYour language here is unclear and your language on this from your website seems conflicting with your statements.  \\n\\nIf I understand, WASC Senior College and University Commission (WSCUC) has issued you a temporary/contingent/experimental accreditation so that you can operate NOW as if you were a fully accredited institution, while you work through some kind of an incubation / probationary / period under the guidance and assistance of Dominican University.  \\n\\nYou can\\'t issue your own diplomas yet, and graduates are awarded degrees from Dominican until you achieve full Accreditation status.  \\n\\nAchieving full Accreditation is not, I assume, a sure-thing, is it? You have some hoops to jump through and competencies to display mastery of to WSCUC to receive their formal, blessing, right?  \\n\\nWhich is why I find this language misleading:  \\n\\n> Make School is the first in the country to pursue accreditation under a new policy called the “Incubation Policy”created by the WASC Senior College and University Commission (WSCUC), the regional accreditor covering California.  \\n\\nBut you aren\\'t really Accredited yet, right? You\\'ve been granted an experimental incubation permit to operate as if you were accredited. Right?  \\n\\nI don\\'t think any of this invalidates your ability to deliver an education, I\\'m just not sure you are stating the facts of the situation clearly. Or, I must admit, it\\'s also possible I misunderstand.  \\n\\n> ~2 year Bachelor instead of 4 years  \\n\\nAhh yes. \"Accelerated Coursework\". University of Phoenix made a big deal of this too.  \\n\\nA 4-year degree in 2 years. There are ONLY two ways to accomplish this:  \\n\\n1. You work the student HARD. Aggressive course loads, intensive volumes of homework, and an increased risk of poor retention, student stress & drop-out rates, and low consumer satisfaction.  \\n2. You eliminate content from classes & coursework from the curriculum and simply teach less content, but call it the same degree.  \\n\\nWhich approach does your institution associate with?  \\n\\nPlease don\\'t say that you\\'ve revolutionized education with an exciting and unique approach to the learning process.  \\n\\n\\n> Instructors have personal relationships with students: instructors and students get to know each other on an informal basis as mentors instead of just being instructors  \\n\\nYou feel this is sufficiently sustainable to promote as a feature of the institution?  \\n\\n\\n> Project based: As opposed to strictly focusing on taking tests and theory of computer science, you actually build real projects. You leave the school with 5-6 portfolio projects of software you can show employers. We hear \"it\\'s not what you know, it\\'s what you can do.\" Make School is the embodiment of that Mantra  \\n\\nWhat you are kind of describing is a trade school or boot camp. Is this a glorified boot camp? or is this a college education?  \\n\\nI understand the degree is an Applied Science degree, so I respect and understand that there will be less depth, and that\\'s not a bad thing.  \\n\\nBut what I fear is that one possible interpretation of what you are saying here is that you don;t teach how software works, you just teach how to pound out syntax.  \\n\\nAnd there are totally a whole lot of jobs in the US for people to pound out syntax. They exist, they are hiring and that pay pretty well.  \\n\\nBut they are mostly filled with contract employees from domestic and foreign sources. Which kind of brings be back to that H1B factory concept again. (sorry)  \\n\\n\\n> Community: at 200 students, we create a really tight nit community, rich with peer learning and support. Students are constantly supporting each other and nearly 1/2 of all senior students are peer mentors!  \\n\\n200 students... each earning I dunno 100k per graduate, and each kicking back what, 10-15% of their salaries to repay their education over 5-10 years?  \\n\\n200 students X $15,000 = Thats $3 Million in revenues per graduating class. That doesn\\'t actually feel like a lot of money in SanFran. Even with 5 or 8 graduated classes under your belt.  \\n\\nAre you adequately funded? Where is the money coming from?  \\nWill you exist 10 years from today?  \\nWill my diploma still be relevant 10 years from now?  \\n\\n\\n> Seniors are working in teams to build software for actual organizations.  \\n\\nIs that legal? How are the students being compensated? Are they 1099 contact employees to those employers? Who pays the taxes?  \\n\\nIs that a revenue stream for the institution? Providing cheap labor?  \\n\\n\\n> Some collaborating companies run by graduates of YC or alumni. We also have industry review our curriculum, working engineers come in and mentor, and we teach students how to reach out to mentors in industry.  \\n\\nThese are the same bullet points Full Sail University likes to tout and highlight.  \\n\\n\\n> We look for work ethic, professionalism, and passion for making/creating. Our community tends to be quite varied and our latest actually skews more towards little to no prior coding experience at the time they applied.  \\n\\n> We don\\'t require SAT/ACT score, but we will take a look at your your transcripts. That being said, unless there\\'s scary stuff in there it\\'s not really what we go by. We’re more interested in the projects you worked on, what you learned, and how you’d be excited to apply those learnings while at Make School.  \\n\\n> Concretely speaking, we require a written application, transcripts, then we invite you for a phone interview, and if you don\\'t have much prior experience we ask you to complete an online programming class/challenge called Ramp.  \\n\\nIt feels like your admissions criteria is off the hook with fluffiness, abstractness, non-specifics and frankly, things desperate applicants want to hear.  \\nWho are you catering to? What actually is your target audience of students?  \\n\\nUniversity of Phoenix makes a big deal about not needing test scores too.  \\nSo does Full Sail.  \\n\\n> We don\\'t publish an acceptance rate.  \\n\\nWhy not?  \\n\\nWill you collect & provide a Common Data Set so Guidance Counselors & Admissions Consultants can properly compare your institution to your peers & contemporaries?'], ['so you take 20% of a students salary..for how long do you get the 20%? one year? more?'], ['How is Make school similar to a traditional college and how is it different?'], [\"Make School's curriculum covers the majority of CS related jobs such as web, mobile and data.

Disrupt. Glad to see you old friend. \\n\\n>Our students work with companies on real world projects, live in downtown San Francisco, and only pay tuition if they get a job.\\n\\nBrilliant. You're like a recruiter, but a super early-stage one. One would guess that you get paid by larger organizations to complete projects and someone on your staff will do them if the student group couldn't complete it. This could also prevent other workers that aren't students from landing a full-time or contract job with the company.\\n\\nSo, you really don't care if students pay back tuition since you're taking their money as a contract employee, though it might be a bit less than a normal employee.

I’ve summarized your questions to capture the jist of what you’re asking.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n* **How are you funded? Where does the money come from? If you aren’t taking tuition up-front, how are you funding day to day operations.**\\n\\nWe are currently funded through a combination of venture capital - we’ve raised $30 million from investors to help build this - and borrowing money against the Income Share Agreements that students sign (which we call ISA debt).Our venture capital funds our growth and expansion. It is largely from education and impact focused investors (eg. one of our lead investors is primarily funded by the World Bank).\\n\\nOur day to day operations are funded by ISA debt, it’s the key to our long term sustainability. In essence, we borrow money when students enroll in the program equal to a fraction of their eventual tuition payback. When students get jobs and start paying, we then pay back our lender. This is similar to a working capital loan (eg. a company borrows money to manufacture a product and pays it back once it sells the product).\\n\\nThe big contrast to traditional student debt is that we as an institution hold the debt rather than having individual students hold the debt. That means we’re aggregating risk that students carry into a shared pool. So if one student has a bad outcome we are on the hook, not the student. This effectively aligns our incentives with the students incentives and protects students from downside risk. This model is highly sustainable if our outcomes continue to be strong, so we’re laser focused on that as an institution.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n* **Are you structured as a For-Profit institution?**\\n\\nThe campus is a cooperation between two entities, Dominican University (non-profit) and Make School PBC. PBC stands for [Public Benefit Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-benefit_corporation#Delaware), which is a new class of for-profit company that exists to serve a public benefit - in our case creating upward mobility for students of all backgrounds. The academic program is housed on the non-profit side, so students are enrolled at a non-profit college, not a for-profit. \\n\\nWe’re big believers in the idea of Conscious Capitalism, which aims to redirect enterprises to create social impact as their primary goal. One of our investors Kapor Capital just released an [impact report](https://impact.kaporcapital.com/) talking more about how companies who are creating sizable positive world impact are outperforming their peers. So we think the future economy will largely be driven by Public Benefit Corporations rather than self serving corporations.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n* **You mention that you have some quantity of scholarships even for international applicants. How can you afford that?**\\n\\nWe don’t offer scholarships to international students. We offer Income Share Agreements which enable students to pay tuition through a percentage of their earnings once they get a job. International students are eligible for OPT/CPT which gives them a few years of guaranteed work in the US before needing to apply for an H1-B.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n* **If I understand, WASC Senior College and University Commission (WSCUC) has issued you a temporary/contingent/experimental accreditation so that you can operate NOW as if you were a fully accredited institution, while you work through some kind of an incubation / probationary / period under the guidance and assistance of Dominican University. You can't issue your own diplomas yet, and graduates are awarded degrees from Dominican until you achieve full Accreditation status. Achieving full Accreditation is not, I assume, a sure-thing, is it? You have some hoops to jump through and competencies to display mastery of to WSCUC to receive their formal, blessing, right?**\\n\\nPretty close. Make School PBC itself has not been accredited. The program itself - the Bachelors of Applied Computer Science offered by Make School at Dominican - is accredited, not provisionally, and with no max duration. We won’t ditch this structure until we’ve become independently accredited, so essentially students will continue to get degrees from Make School at Dominican until Make School itself is independently accredited. If that takes longer, it won’t affect our students’ ability to get a bachelors degree.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n* **To offer a 4-year degree in 2-2.5 years, you must work the students hard with aggressive course loads or eliminate content from the curriculum and call it the same degree. Which approach do you take?**\\n\\nWe haven’t cut content, students take a full 124 unit course load to earn the degree. We do work students harder than traditional institutions. They’re required to work \\\\~50 hours a week and take classes or a credit granting internship over the summers. This puts students on track to graduate in 2-2.5 years.\\n\\nThis is a similar workload to what they would see in their first job, so we don’t feel it’s working them too hard. We actually feel traditional colleges don’t work students hard enough (with some exceptions, like MIT). Given that time spent in college has a huge impact on the cost and opportunity cost of the education, we feel it’s better to ask a heavier workload in order to provide a cheaper degree.Reducing cost of college and increasing ROI is critical to fix the student debt crisis, time to degree is a big lever here. There’s also a lot of recent research that having summers off and longer degree times makes it less likely for low income students to graduate (it’s more likely that family needs, etc get in the way), so we expect shorter more intense degrees to be a general trend. We’re already seeing this with the federal government offering a year round pell grant to low income students.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n* **You promote that instructors have personal relationships with students. Is this sufficiently sustainable?**\\n\\nIt is sustainable. Unlike traditional institutions, most of your tuition dollars go towards paying instructors since we feel that’s most critical to a quality education. And we’re working to reduce the burden on instructors by streamlining administrative tasks. We also don’t require instructors to do research, so that increases their focus on spending time with students. Teaching colleges used to do this back in the day, before institutions all tried to compete for prestige as research institutions.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n* **You emphasize building real world projects and a portfolio, emphasizing “it’s not what you know, it’s what you can do”. This sounds like a trade school or a bootcamp - is it?**\\n\\nPart of what we teach overlaps with trade schools and bootcamps - real world software development. In addition to that, we go pretty in depth into computer science theory, have a full complement of general education courses, and have courses focused on soft skills and life skills.\\n\\nI think one the challenges with the current rhetoric around higher education is the notion that you can either get a broad based education or get a vocational education. When in reality, people are T shaped. We need the general education to understand the world and act as upstanding citizens, while we need vocational skills to excel in a career. We think you can - and should - learn both in college.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n* **I understand this is a degree in Applied Science, so there will be less depth in Computer Science theory. One interpretation of this is that you don’t teach how software works, you just teach how to pound out syntax. Is that the case? Are there enough jobs for the skills you are training?**\\n\\nThere’s a bit less depth in CS theory, but we do teach how software, systems, and architecture work. We also have a heavy emphasis on project management, communication, and collaboration - which tend to be the skills that allow people to step into senior engineering or management roles. Our students often compete for jobs with grads from Stanford, UC Berkeley, and other top CS programs. They’ve also shown to have pretty strong early career trajectories - some have started managing teams within a couple years of entering the workforce.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n* **It seems as if the revenue you make may not be enough to sustain your operations today. Are you adequately funded? Where is the money coming from? Will you exist 10 years from today?**\\n\\nSee question 1 above. As long as we maintain strong outcomes for our students, our model will be sustainable. Arguably more sustainable than many universities today, given that [25% of private colleges are running a budget deficit](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2018/08/03/despite-strong-economy-worrying-financial-signs-for-higher-education/).\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n* **Is it legal for students to be working on software for actual organizations? How are they being compensated? Is this a revenue stream for the institution?**\\n\\nMost student projects are open source or for non profit or impact oriented institutions. They aren’t getting paid - neither are we - but they do get academic credit. This is legal since they get credit, and some universities (like Stanford) have similar courses!\\n\\n***This post is too long so answering the remaining questions*** [***in a comment***](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/d9c1mg/i_dropped_out_of_mit_and_started_a_new_college_in/f1hueoe)***!***\"], ['This comment digs deep.\\n\\nAlso, have you noticed that origins of some of the other questions seem very suspect?

I sincerely invite you to please prove me wrong.  \\n\\nThe College of William and Mary is our nation\\'s second oldest institution of higher learning.  \\n\\nW&M offers undergraduate, Masters and Doctorate degrees in Education.  \\n\\nFrom W&M\\'s website:  \\n\\nhttps://www.wm.edu/about/administration/provost/documents/credit-hour-policy.pdf  \\n\\n*Federal Definition of the Credit Hour (from USDOE): For purposes of the application of this policy and in accord with federal regulations, a credit hour is an amount of work represented in\\nintended learning outcomes and verified by evidence of student achievement that is an institutionally established equivalency that reasonably approximates*  \\n\\n1. Not less than one hour of classroom or direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours out of class student work each week for approximately fifteen weeks for one semester or trimester hour of credit, or ten to twelve weeks for one quarter hour of credit, or the equivalent amount of work over a different amount of time, or   \\n2. At least an equivalent amount of work as required outlined in item 1 above for other academic activities as established by the institution including laboratory work, internships, practica, studio work, and other academic work leading to the award of credit hours.  \\n\\n\\nSo, W&M, in accordance with Federal Guidelines says that one College Credit = 1 hour of instruction + 2 hours of homework per week.  \\n\\nIt\\'s a Federal **Guideline** - not a law. W&M could deviate from it if they wanted to, and if they thought they could deliver the correct quality of education in less time.  \\nThey don\\'t seem to feel they can, so they don\\'t generally deviate from that guideline.  \\nI\\'m completely sure there are a dozen or so specific courses that probably don\\'t meet those guidelines at W&M.  \\nBut I\\'m equally confident that there are just as many courses that exceed the hell out of those guidelines too.  \\n\\n*(Organic Chemistry is coming for your soul.)*  \\n\\n\\nYou are issuing a 4 year degree after requiring only 2 years of education.  \\n\\nSo, where the standard US course load is 15 credit hours per semester, you have to double that.  \\n\\nAre your students receiving 30 hours of classroom instruction plus 60 hours of homework per week?  \\n\\nThat\\'s 90 hours of work. There are only (24*7) 168 hours in a 7-day week. Minus (8*7) 56 hours to sleep leaves 22 un-allocated hours in a 7-day week for student free-time.  \\n\\nI think you said elsewhere that students are enduring about a 50-hour work week, which is about half of what USDOE guidelines suggest for a 30 credit-hour load.  \\n\\nA 15 credit hour workload is 15-hours in-class plus roughly 30 hours of home work/study. That\\'s 45 hours, which is very close to the 50-hours of work you say your students put in per week.  \\n\\nIf we reflect back to my statement in that there are only two ways to deliver an Accelerated Degree:  \\n\\n1. Work the students HARD with intensive workloads.  \\n2. Teach less content, and just skip some stuff.  \\n\\nBased on the information provided, I suspect your educational curriculum is taking shortcuts and teaching less content.  \\n\\nFull Sail University does this too (teaches less content). Their graduates are notorious for having difficulty being hired into advanced roles since they are simply less-educated than their peers.  \\n\\nPlease don\\'t say you\\'ve revolutionized education and found a magical way to streamline the learning process.  \\n\\n1. Crushing workloads.  \\n2. We teach less stuff.  \\n\\nPick one and own it.  \\n\\n\\n\\n> We offer a full complement of general education courses. This is not a trade school or boot camp.

Our students are able to land jobs where depth of understanding is tested for and expected.  \\n\\nI find that to be somewhat difficult to accept, and delightfully difficult to validate, with the exception of one explanation:  \\n\\nIf I graduate from a Top-10 CS university, I know damned well what I am worth.  \\nTop-10 graduates are well recruited. Competition for their skills and abilities are strong.  \\n\\nThey don\\'t have to accept low-ball offers unless they choose to, and each individual has their own reasons to potentially choose to do so.  \\n\\nA Carnegie Mellon graduate is going to ask for a strong salary. They are worth it, and in fairness, they probably have student loans to deal with.  \\nThey made an investment in their education and need to see that return on investment.  \\n\\nYour graduates didn\\'t really make an investment in their education.  \\nThe Make School made an investment in their education.  \\n\\nYour graduates are likely more willing to accept a lower offer, because they have somewhat less pressure to see an ROI.  \\n\\nSecondly, your graduates have undergraduates in Applied Computer Science. That is not a deep, hard-core degree.  \\nIt\\'s a perfectly valid & adequate education for a whole lot of entry level jobs.  \\n\\nBut Uber isn\\'t going to ask your graduates to DESIGN a self-driving car.  \\nThey are going to ask your graduates to pound out some code to CONTRIBUTE to the project of a self-driving car.  \\n\\nSo, to say your graduates \"Our students often compete for jobs that are otherwise being filled by grads from top 10 CS programs\" feels a bit overstated in my opinion.  \\n\\n\\n> You didn’t do the revenue math correctly. 5 years of payback at 20% of salary is more revenue than you calculated. It is sustainable.  \\n\\nYou are right, I failed to see your other comment where you said your ISA requires 20%.

I’ve summarized your questions to capture the jist of what you’re asking.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n* **How are you funded? Where does the money come from? If you aren’t taking tuition up-front, how are you funding day to day operations.**\\n\\nWe are currently funded through a combination of venture capital - we’ve raised $30 million from investors to help build this - and borrowing money against the Income Share Agreements that students sign (which we call ISA debt).Our venture capital funds our growth and expansion. It is largely from education and impact focused investors (eg. one of our lead investors is primarily funded by the World Bank).\\n\\nOur day to day operations are funded by ISA debt, it’s the key to our long term sustainability. In essence, we borrow money when students enroll in the program equal to a fraction of their eventual tuition payback. When students get jobs and start paying, we then pay back our lender. This is similar to a working capital loan (eg. a company borrows money to manufacture a product and pays it back once it sells the product).\\n\\nThe big contrast to traditional student debt is that we as an institution hold the debt rather than having individual students hold the debt. That means we’re aggregating risk that students carry into a shared pool. So if one student has a bad outcome we are on the hook, not the student. This effectively aligns our incentives with the students incentives and protects students from downside risk. This model is highly sustainable if our outcomes continue to be strong, so we’re laser focused on that as an institution.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n* **Are you structured as a For-Profit institution?**\\n\\nThe campus is a cooperation between two entities, Dominican University (non-profit) and Make School PBC. PBC stands for [Public Benefit Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-benefit_corporation#Delaware), which is a new class of for-profit company that exists to serve a public benefit - in our case creating upward mobility for students of all backgrounds. The academic program is housed on the non-profit side, so students are enrolled at a non-profit college, not a for-profit. \\n\\nWe’re big believers in the idea of Conscious Capitalism, which aims to redirect enterprises to create social impact as their primary goal. One of our investors Kapor Capital just released an [impact report](https://impact.kaporcapital.com/) talking more about how companies who are creating sizable positive world impact are outperforming their peers. So we think the future economy will largely be driven by Public Benefit Corporations rather than self serving corporations.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n* **You mention that you have some quantity of scholarships even for international applicants. How can you afford that?**\\n\\nWe don’t offer scholarships to international students. We offer Income Share Agreements which enable students to pay tuition through a percentage of their earnings once they get a job. International students are eligible for OPT/CPT which gives them a few years of guaranteed work in the US before needing to apply for an H1-B.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n* **If I understand, WASC Senior College and University Commission (WSCUC) has issued you a temporary/contingent/experimental accreditation so that you can operate NOW as if you were a fully accredited institution, while you work through some kind of an incubation / probationary / period under the guidance and assistance of Dominican University. You can't issue your own diplomas yet, and graduates are awarded degrees from Dominican until you achieve full Accreditation status. Achieving full Accreditation is not, I assume, a sure-thing, is it? You have some hoops to jump through and competencies to display mastery of to WSCUC to receive their formal, blessing, right?**\\n\\nPretty close. Make School PBC itself has not been accredited. The program itself - the Bachelors of Applied Computer Science offered by Make School at Dominican - is accredited, not provisionally, and with no max duration. We won’t ditch this structure until we’ve become independently accredited, so essentially students will continue to get degrees from Make School at Dominican until Make School itself is independently accredited. If that takes longer, it won’t affect our students’ ability to get a bachelors degree.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n* **To offer a 4-year degree in 2-2.5 years, you must work the students hard with aggressive course loads or eliminate content from the curriculum and call it the same degree. Which approach do you take?**\\n\\nWe haven’t cut content, students take a full 124 unit course load to earn the degree. We do work students harder than traditional institutions. They’re required to work \\\\~50 hours a week and take classes or a credit granting internship over the summers. This puts students on track to graduate in 2-2.5 years.\\n\\nThis is a similar workload to what they would see in their first job, so we don’t feel it’s working them too hard. We actually feel traditional colleges don’t work students hard enough (with some exceptions, like MIT). Given that time spent in college has a huge impact on the cost and opportunity cost of the education, we feel it’s better to ask a heavier workload in order to provide a cheaper degree.Reducing cost of college and increasing ROI is critical to fix the student debt crisis, time to degree is a big lever here. There’s also a lot of recent research that having summers off and longer degree times makes it less likely for low income students to graduate (it’s more likely that family needs, etc get in the way), so we expect shorter more intense degrees to be a general trend. We’re already seeing this with the federal government offering a year round pell grant to low income students.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n* **You promote that instructors have personal relationships with students. Is this sufficiently sustainable?**\\n\\nIt is sustainable. Unlike traditional institutions, most of your tuition dollars go towards paying instructors since we feel that’s most critical to a quality education. And we’re working to reduce the burden on instructors by streamlining administrative tasks. We also don’t require instructors to do research, so that increases their focus on spending time with students. Teaching colleges used to do this back in the day, before institutions all tried to compete for prestige as research institutions.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n* **You emphasize building real world projects and a portfolio, emphasizing “it’s not what you know, it’s what you can do”. This sounds like a trade school or a bootcamp - is it?**\\n\\nPart of what we teach overlaps with trade schools and bootcamps - real world software development. In addition to that, we go pretty in depth into computer science theory, have a full complement of general education courses, and have courses focused on soft skills and life skills.\\n\\nI think one the challenges with the current rhetoric around higher education is the notion that you can either get a broad based education or get a vocational education. When in reality, people are T shaped. We need the general education to understand the world and act as upstanding citizens, while we need vocational skills to excel in a career. We think you can - and should - learn both in college.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n* **I understand this is a degree in Applied Science, so there will be less depth in Computer Science theory. One interpretation of this is that you don’t teach how software works, you just teach how to pound out syntax. Is that the case? Are there enough jobs for the skills you are training?**\\n\\nThere’s a bit less depth in CS theory, but we do teach how software, systems, and architecture work. We also have a heavy emphasis on project management, communication, and collaboration - which tend to be the skills that allow people to step into senior engineering or management roles. Our students often compete for jobs with grads from Stanford, UC Berkeley, and other top CS programs. They’ve also shown to have pretty strong early career trajectories - some have started managing teams within a couple years of entering the workforce.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n* **It seems as if the revenue you make may not be enough to sustain your operations today. Are you adequately funded? Where is the money coming from? Will you exist 10 years from today?**\\n\\nSee question 1 above. As long as we maintain strong outcomes for our students, our model will be sustainable. Arguably more sustainable than many universities today, given that [25% of private colleges are running a budget deficit](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2018/08/03/despite-strong-economy-worrying-financial-signs-for-higher-education/).\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n* **Is it legal for students to be working on software for actual organizations? How are they being compensated? Is this a revenue stream for the institution?**\\n\\nMost student projects are open source or for non profit or impact oriented institutions. They aren’t getting paid - neither are we - but they do get academic credit. This is legal since they get credit, and some universities (like Stanford) have similar courses!\\n\\n***This post is too long so answering the remaining questions*** [***in a comment***](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/d9c1mg/i_dropped_out_of_mit_and_started_a_new_college_in/f1hueoe)***!***\", 'This comment digs deep.\\n\\nAlso, have you noticed that origins of some of the other questions seem very suspect?

Here\\'s a copy of the text:\\n\\n> ####Comp sci and engineering students\\n\\n> Hey, aspiring comp sci students. Recently, there was a college fair at out school and I found out about this college named \"Make School\". This college, located in San Francisco, is the next level of colleges. It offers a degree in software engineering and u receive a bachelor\\'s within 2-3 years. However, college tuition is high af. But you don\\'t pay upfront. Instead, u start paying ur tuition when u get a job. It\\'s not a fake college. It is legit. U can search it up if u don\\'t believe me. the acceptance rate is hella low too- like 10%\\n\\n*For the sake of veracity, I\\'d be grateful if any other users who read the post before he deleted it can verify what I\\'m saying here.*', \"We accept applicants with little to no prior programming experience at the time of application. For those applicants, the last step of the application process is to complete an online course/coding challenge called Ramp. Current students TA the class and we really want you to succeed - it's a way for you to validate you enjoy coding in the way we teach it and for us to validate your commitment, time management skills, and speed of learning.\", \"If you intend to major in Economics,  but have an interest in CS, you'll probably want the theory background.\", \"We had a awesome student go from homeless before the program to making 6 figures :) But that's just off the top of my head, honestly we get some students with really fascinating non-traditional backgrounds (given that we're a non traditional school after all)\", \"That’s a great question! I’m not sure if you know this already, but we actually offer four tracks at Make School: front-end web, back-end, mobile and data science. All those incorporate a lot of product development, both the design side and entrepreneurial side. We also offer general education courses (philosophy, ethics, sciences) and non-technical classes that help students learn communication skills, nutrition, science, and how to really show up in a start-up setting. These are the sorts of things I was missing at MIT and what we’re thrilled to be providing at Make School.   \\n\\n\\nIn terms of other majors, I've been thinking a lot about climate related studies these days...\", \"Thanks for the kudos! We definitely agree this is super important.\\n\\nAs an organization, we spend a lot of time talking to students and provide a greater number of avenues for feedback than before - satisfaction surveys, student support staff, coaching relationships, and anonymous feedback boxes.\\n\\nCurrent students report substantially increased satisfaction from prior years based on aggregate data from the satisfaction surveys. We're thrilled that we've been able to continue to make the program better over time. That said, there are plenty of things we still need to improve.\\n\\nBased on casual conversations, Alumni have expressed general excitement by the new changes we've been making. Particularly, the program is more structured, has a higher diversity of courses, and the accreditation has provided increased legitimacy of the program and employer facing brand. We do have some alumni who preferred the program when it was more alternative and less structured, so not everyone is a fan of the changes.\\n\\nIt sounds like you're also asking about my personal time spent with students. As founders, we spend less time talking to students than we did before. Most of my relationships with students are in a casual context (eg. Friday evening D&D games and the likes) rather than a formal context, while my cofounder mostly sits in on town halls and reviews student feedback. We also give student advice on projects and startups if they reach out to us!\\n\\nWe've shifted to spending less formal time with students because we've been fortunate to have hired a really strong team who are much better at supporting students than we are, whether that's through teaching, counseling, coaching, or other forms of student support. We're big believers in the idea of a distributed ownership culture within the organization, so we've focused our time on helping coach our team members to serve students well and act in alignment with the principles we believe in. Ultimately, Make School is not about any one person, it's about a community built around a set of principles, the goal is to support students far more despite spending less time with me or Ashu directly.\", 'We have a limited number of full tuition ISAs available for international applicants and are in financial need.', \"We don't require SAT/ACT and don't care that much about transcripts though those courses will help! It's about what you're created and the strongest evidence of your strong work ethic, whether that's your classes or something from outside of class (clubs, community, jobs, family obligations to name a few)\", 'One question I love to ask is \"What exists in this world because you created it?\". Could be an art project, a club, an event you organized, or of course a software project.   \\n\\n\\nI\\'d say the most important thing is to be organized about scheduling it promptly and showing up on time. You have no idea how many students aren\\'t on top of their email and calendar and either forget to schedule or forget to show up for their scheduled interview...', 'We got our initial funding from Y Combinator, then from impact/education investors.', 'We do not. We are friendly with many startups abroad though, so if a student wanted to do an internship abroad we could definitely connect them to companies.', 'Holy shit. I haven’t read this yet but I’m astounded you replied. These comments are a lot to unpack. Will be back next week once I’m done reading them.', \"* **It feels like your admissions criteria is mostly abstract and focused on soft skills rather than hard metrics. Who are you catering to? What actually is your target audience of students?**\\n\\nWe’ve made a deliberate decision to avoid the hard metrics that traditional institutions look at. Recent studies on SAT scores have shown no correlation between test scores and college success, so more institutions (University of Chicago being the most prominent) are becoming test optional.\\n\\nGPA does have a stronger correlation to college success, not because of what students have learned in high school but because it demonstrates they can show up and work hard. But focusing on GPA tends to discount the hidden work low income students often need to do to support their families. So we allow students to demonstrate their work ethic through different means.\\xa0\\n\\nWe ask students to demonstrate their work ethic by writing in their application about projects they’ve driven to completion in or outside of school, jobs they’ve held, non-profits they’ve volunteered at, or ways they’ve supported their families and communities. We also ask most students to complete our Ramp program, an online or in person programming class that allows them to demonstrate their commitment and work ethic.\\n\\nIn essence, we want the admissions process to be a stepladder, not a locked gate for students. We’ve had sufficient success getting students with a variety of academic backgrounds great jobs into tech - some of our top outcomes are from students who had poor high school GPAs or transferred from community colleges.That’s not to say Make School is a good fit for everyone - it’s not. But if you’re excited about a career in tech and can show up and work hard, we can get you there!\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n* **Why don’t you publish an acceptance rate?**\\n\\nWe don't publish this because we don't think it's a good metric for colleges to focus on. Bragging about selectivity doesn’t help students, and we want our image to be about inclusivity not exclusivity.\\xa0\\n\\nMore concretely, publishing an acceptance rate often dissuades low-income students from applying, even if they would be a good fit. We’d rather encourage more students to apply, especially the ones this could be a life changer for. For students who don’t get in, we give guidance on how they can earn future admission or suggest alternate programs they can apply to now. Admissions should be about [building ladders, not locking gates](https://medium.com/make-school/college-admissions-is-a-regressive-tax-on-low-income-students-a0c8cf7895).\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n* **Will you collect and provide a common data set so guidance counselors and admissions consultants can compare your institution to your peers and contemporaries?**\\n\\nYes!

Will revise formatting in the morning.  \\n\\nNo need to apologize. I appreciate you taking the time to respond.  \\n\\n> The campus is a cooperation betweeen two entities, Dominican University (non-profit) and Make School PBC (a public benefit corporation, a type of for profit). The funding was raised by the Make School PBC side.  \\n\\nThank you for the clarification. You are a For-Profit institution.  \\nThat doesn\\'t make you evil. But, that does color some of your operational practices, and your customers (the students) should be aware of that reality.  \\n\\n> We don’t offer scholarships to international students. We offer ISAs which allow students to fund tuition by committing to a % of post-grad payback, which essentially means we also expect we will get paid back by international students given that they can work for several years in the US under OPT/CPT before needing an H1-B.  \\n\\nThank you for the clarification.  \\nDoes your operational model influence your decision to accept applicants from countries where you have higher confidence of being able to get your money back?  \\n\\nAre you more or less likely to accept an applicant from China, for example?  \\nIf a Chinese applicant is accepted, completes your education, works for a year or two, then runs home to China, there is no real likelihood that you will ever get your money.  \\nDoes this influence your admissions practices?  \\n\\n> Not really sure how we benefit by becoming an H1-B processing plant (we will still of course recruit international students) given our tuition model and the nature of the H1-B lottery.  \\n\\nOh, it certainly wouldn\\'t benefit you. It would benefit your investors. As a For-Profit institution, with a high operational cost structure you are pretty exposed to external influence.  \\n\\nIf Alphabet tells you to admit more cheap labor from the Philippines, and help them get an accelerated degree, and helps you create an Accelerated Masters program they get a legitimate-looking talent pipeline.  \\n\\n> Make School PBC itself has not been accredited. The program itself - the Bachelors of Applied Computer Science offered by Make School at Dominican - is accredited, not provisionally, and with no max duration.  \\n\\nBased on this, it\\'s clear my understanding was incomplete at best and incorrect at worst. So thank you for the correction.  \\n\\nBut I think the reality that your Accreditation circumvented the normal process and exists under this new Incubator mechanism should continue to be highlighted. Your website does a reasonable job of this.  \\n\\n\\n> We didn’t cut content.  \\n\\nI\\'m gonna be honest: I don\\'t believe you, and I don\\'t believe you can back that up with evidence or fact. I sincerely invite you to please prove me wrong.  \\n\\nThe College of William and Mary is our nation\\'s second oldest institution of higher learning.  \\n\\nW&M offers undergraduate, Masters and Doctorate degrees in Education.  \\n\\nFrom W&M\\'s website:  \\n\\nhttps://www.wm.edu/about/administration/provost/documents/credit-hour-policy.pdf  \\n\\n*Federal Definition of the Credit Hour (from USDOE): For purposes of the application of this policy and in accord with federal regulations, a credit hour is an amount of work represented in\\nintended learning outcomes and verified by evidence of student achievement that is an institutionally established equivalency that reasonably approximates*  \\n\\n1. Not less than one hour of classroom or direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours out of class student work each week for approximately fifteen weeks for one semester or trimester hour of credit, or ten to twelve weeks for one quarter hour of credit, or the equivalent amount of work over a different amount of time, or   \\n2. At least an equivalent amount of work as required outlined in item 1 above for other academic activities as established by the institution including laboratory work, internships, practica, studio work, and other academic work leading to the award of credit hours.  \\n\\n\\nSo, W&M, in accordance with Federal Guidelines says that one College Credit = 1 hour of instruction + 2 hours of homework per week.  \\n\\nIt\\'s a Federal **Guideline** - not a law. W&M could deviate from it if they wanted to, and if they thought they could deliver the correct quality of education in less time.  \\nThey don\\'t seem to feel they can, so they don\\'t generally deviate from that guideline.  \\nI\\'m completely sure there are a dozen or so specific courses that probably don\\'t meet those guidelines at W&M.  \\nBut I\\'m equally confident that there are just as many courses that exceed the hell out of those guidelines too.  \\n\\n*(Organic Chemistry is coming for your soul.)*  \\n\\n\\nYou are issuing a 4 year degree after requiring only 2 years of education.  \\n\\nSo, where the standard US course load is 15 credit hours per semester, you have to double that.  \\n\\nAre your students receiving 30 hours of classroom instruction plus 60 hours of homework per week?  \\n\\nThat\\'s 90 hours of work. There are only (24*7) 168 hours in a 7-day week. Minus (8*7) 56 hours to sleep leaves 22 un-allocated hours in a 7-day week for student free-time.  \\n\\nI think you said elsewhere that students are enduring about a 50-hour work week, which is about half of what USDOE guidelines suggest for a 30 credit-hour load.  \\n\\nA 15 credit hour workload is 15-hours in-class plus roughly 30 hours of home work/study. That\\'s 45 hours, which is very close to the 50-hours of work you say your students put in per week.  \\n\\nIf we reflect back to my statement in that there are only two ways to deliver an Accelerated Degree:  \\n\\n1. Work the students HARD with intensive workloads.  \\n2. Teach less content, and just skip some stuff.  \\n\\nBased on the information provided, I suspect your educational curriculum is taking shortcuts and teaching less content.  \\n\\nFull Sail University does this too (teaches less content). Their graduates are notorious for having difficulty being hired into advanced roles since they are simply less-educated than their peers.  \\n\\nPlease don\\'t say you\\'ve revolutionized education and found a magical way to streamline the learning process.  \\n\\n1. Crushing workloads.  \\n2. We teach less stuff.  \\n\\nPick one and own it.  \\n\\n\\n\\n> We offer a full complement of general education courses. This is not a trade school or boot camp. It’s not a traditional university either though.  \\n\\nCool. Do you provide a degree roadmap similar to this:  \\n\\nhttps://csd.cmu.edu/academic/undergraduate/bachelors-curriculum-admitted-2018  \\n\\n> Our students often compete for jobs that are otherwise being filled by grads from top 10 CS programs. Our students are able to land jobs where depth of understanding is tested for and expected.  \\n\\nI find that to be somewhat difficult to accept, and delightfully difficult to validate, with the exception of one explanation:  \\n\\nIf I graduate from a Top-10 CS university, I know damned well what I am worth.  \\nTop-10 graduates are well recruited. Competition for their skills and abilities are strong.  \\n\\nThey don\\'t have to accept low-ball offers unless they choose to, and each individual has their own reasons to potentially choose to do so.  \\n\\nA Carnegie Mellon graduate is going to ask for a strong salary. They are worth it, and in fairness, they probably have student loans to deal with.  \\nThey made an investment in their education and need to see that return on investment.  \\n\\nYour graduates didn\\'t really make an investment in their education.  \\nThe Make School made an investment in their education.  \\n\\nYour graduates are likely more willing to accept a lower offer, because they have somewhat less pressure to see an ROI.  \\n\\nSecondly, your graduates have undergraduates in Applied Computer Science. That is not a deep, hard-core degree.  \\nIt\\'s a perfectly valid & adequate education for a whole lot of entry level jobs.  \\n\\nBut Uber isn\\'t going to ask your graduates to DESIGN a self-driving car.  \\nThey are going to ask your graduates to pound out some code to CONTRIBUTE to the project of a self-driving car.  \\n\\nSo, to say your graduates \"Our students often compete for jobs that are otherwise being filled by grads from top 10 CS programs\" feels a bit overstated in my opinion.  \\n\\n\\n> You didn’t do the revenue math correctly. 5 years of payback at 20% of salary is more revenue than you calculated. It is sustainable.  \\n\\nYou are right, I failed to see your other comment where you said your ISA requires 20%. I was wrong about that.  \\n\\nBut, I think your marketing materials and presentation of information is incomplete.  \\n\\nGraduates earn up to $100k. You take 20%. Graduate now has $80k to work with in SanFran / SV.  \\n\\nhttp://podshare.com/  \\n\\nPodShare made national news not too long ago for providing an affordable housing option in the Silicon Valley area, by providing a \"pod\" which is a bed to sleep in, plus access to shared living space for $1,500 a month. And this is considered a good deal in that employment area.  \\n\\nSuffice to say that $100k of salary isn\\'t really all that much money in the San Francisco / SV area.  \\n\\nIt isn\\'t really a university\\'s responsibility to spell out their graduate\\'s lifetime earnings potential, but traditional universities don\\'t make headlines and major bullet points of their graduates initial salaries either. Yes, good universities DO provide access to employment outcomes for their graduates, but you usually have to go digging for that data. You\\'re setting that data up in the front as a selling point for your institution, so it deserves greater scrutiny as a result, IMO.', 'Response 2 of 2:  \\n\\n\\n> Students can work on projects for industry partners without getting paid if they are getting academic credit. Not a revenue stream.  \\n\\nStudents from Top-10 and Top-50 CS universities laugh at unpaid internships. (as they should, in my opinion)  \\nYou seem to be advocating for it as a great and glorious benefit for your students.  \\n\\nProfessional Developers get paid for writing code.  \\nYour students are writing that same code, specifically for real-world products and projects without financial compensation.  \\n\\n\"We pay them with experience, oh and college credit.\"  \\n\\nIf you say this is legal, and ethical and all above-board, I\\'ll take your word for it.  \\nI don\\'t think I like it.

The majority of incoming students must complete Ramp, an online programming class/evaluation we administer to evaluate applicants.  \\n\\nYeah I kind of had a shower thought about that whole situation this morning.  \\nYour primary admissions criteria is \"Can we get a real Return on Investment from this applicant?\" right?  \\n\\nYou are a For-Profit institution of education.  \\nYou are not taking money up-front.  \\nAll your revenues are depending on each graduate\\'s ability to land a six-figure income.  \\n\\nSo, employability must be a key consideration in admissions.  \\n\\n\\nOnce again, I\\'m at a loss for the right clarity of emotion to describe what I don\\'t like about that arrangement.  \\n\\nI mean Harvard admits people they believe are likely to succeed and represent their institution well after graduation.  \\nThey just have no financial interest in that success.  \\n\\nIf that individual\\'s version of success is to get employed by a not-for-profit Gender-Rights Think Tank and get paid $30k for the next 20 years, Harvard doesn\\'t care. They wish you well, invite you to Alumni Association lunches and ask you if you need any help publishing research.  \\n\\nYou NEED your graduates to earn the biggest salaries they can, so you get paid.  \\n\\nSomething about this relationship bugs me, but I can\\'t describe what it is.  \\nMaybe it\\'s just the simplicity of the relationship. It\\'s right there for all to see. It\\'s not abstract. It\\'s not conceptual.  \\nYou get paid when your students get paid.  \\n\\nI admit & acknowledge that what I don\\'t like about the relationship is that I haven\\'t come to terms, personally with the relationship.  \\n\\nI just know something about it is bugging me.  \\n\\n> Top colleges are going test optional too.  \\n\\nYeah, but they don\\'t have a financial interest in the educational outcomes.  \\n\\nIf I tell you during our admissions interview that my dream is to focus on Free Software and I can\\'t wait to work for one of Richard Stallman\\'s Free Software think tanks, what does that do for my admissions chances?  \\n\\nYour website says you require your students to own a recent-generation MacBook Pro, which implies you leverage commercial development tools.  \\n\\nDid Apple tell you to establish that standard?  \\n\\nI mean, shouldn\\'t I be able to be a successful developer with a $100 refurbished ThinkPad running Linux and Open Source development tools?  \\n\\n\\n> Not to mention University of Phoenix and Full Sail don’t place their students at Facebook, Google, Twitch, NASA, Lyft, Tesla, Yelp, etc...  \\n\\nThat\\'s fair feedback.  \\nBut I still wonder what ROLES you placed your students at those same institutions into.  \\n\\nApplied CompSci == Code Pounder.  \\n\\nTraditional Computer Science, with emphasis on Machine Learning == Project Lead Developer.  \\n\\n\\n> Low-income students often self-select out of applying when given acceptance rates, so we don’t publish them.  \\n\\nOh how noble of you.  \\nWe can\\'t evaluate your admissions process fairly without the data, but you don\\'t want to provide the data because it might... what exactly?

I saw a few documentaries and I was skeptical of the state\\'s case, so I read every book on the case and read some trial transcripts as well. \\n\\nI can address each one of these concerns. \\n\\n1. Scott saw Amber 5-6 times actually. And each time it was a mutli-day visit. Their first date was two nights together at a hotel, a fancy dinner at a Japanese restaurant, going to the park etc. \\n2. On Christmas Eve morning at 8:40- 8:44 to be exact someone looked up The Gap and looked at scarves, and there was a pop up for an umbrella stand. Then the person accessed Scott\\'s password protected email. That was even testified about at trial. \\n3. No one saw Laci walking the dog. All four who \"saw\" Laci were not called at trial because there stories were so off.  The people interviewed in the documentary The Murder of Laci Peterson were apparent “witnesses” who were never interviewed by the police and were not called at trial. Why? Because when Geragos interviewed them he found them to be unreliable, confused, or just wrong. **Homer Maldonado** claimed to have seen Laci walking the dog three times…during times she was proven to be elsewhere. Maldonado also refused to be interviewed by police or Scott\\'s attorney\\'s PIs. Because of this he was not called. **Vivian Mitchell** was another witness who claimed she saw Laci walking the dog on Dec. 24th. She then specified she knew exactly the time because she saw Laci during the football game on TV, but there were no football games on TV on the 24th. (Vivian had seen Laci on a different day.) Vivian was also 80 years old and her husband was 84. Her husband Bill told police he did not remember ever seeing Laci. **Mike Chiavetta** remembered seeing a woman walking a Golden Retriever in La Loma park on the most likely 24th but said that it was a bright sunny day and the park was filled with people. It was misty and overcast on the 24th although the 23rd was bright and sunny. Scott supporters will have you believe that Laci was abducted right after the Chiavetta sighting even though Chiavetta claims the park was filled with people that day. Also, Chiavetta never reported he saw Laci, he saw a woman in a white shirt walking a Golden Retriever. When asked if she was pregnant, he said “I don’t know.” **Tom Harshman** is the man who saw a pregnant woman pushed into a van on the 24th of December between 2 and 4 pm, however police documentation says this was not reported until the 28th. In between 2 and 4 pm, he saw a woman in a red shirt and black pants urinating against a fence. There was a man standing over her and she looked scared. Then he saw a hand reach out of a van and pull the woman into the van. The tip was not investigated by the Modesto police department because they circumstance, location, and clothing did not fit. So who saw Laci? Was It someone besides the four \"witnesses\" I profiled? I could not find any others in my research.\\n4. Scott most likely killed Laci by smothering. Where were the injuries? Scott had several small cuts on his hands that were noted at his interview on the 24th. Scott\\'s blood was also located on the comforter in his home (2 drops near the edge of the blanket), and on the drivers door of his truck. \\n5. As for Amber not being a good motive, I agree. I don\\'t think Amber was his motive. Scott\\'s motive was he was tired of hiding his 5 affairs and wanted to be a single playboy. Amber was not Scott\\'s only girlfriend, at trial it emerged that Scott had had at least 4 other affairs. One woman named Janet Ilse, he dated for nearly a year as a married man. There was also a \"health nut\" named Katy, and two others who went by nicknames at trial to protect their privacy. And these are just the ones we know about! \\n6. No one saw Scott\\'s empty boat.  The guy that did see someone that day could not indentify Scott except to saw he thought the guy was white or Hispanic. The other man who Geragos\\' PI claimed he found who \"saw\" Scott\\'s \"empty boat\" could not be found when the trial started by the prosecution OR the defense. \\n7. As for no one saw him load anything into the truck this isn\\'t exactly true. Karen Servas saw Scott load a bunch of five foot longish tarp wrapped things into his truck at approximately 9:40 am that morning. Scott said these were 4 patio umbrellas. The umbrella\\'s were in his truck all day, even at the Marina. he never took them out or stored them like he said he was going to. When they conducted a search warrant on the 26th, investigators found 4 tarp wrapped umbrellas in his truck bed as well as a 5th crumpled tarp. When investigators asked about it, Scott asked if they were going to bring cadaver dogs to his house. When the police decided to take the tarp with them a little later, Scott had spilled gasoline all over it. Cadavers dogs were unable to even sniff it.  \\n\\nUnfortunately, some documentaries still leave out all this information in order to paint Scott in a good light.'], [\"Multiple people? Like who?

Did you read this post properly?', 'And a kill kit in his car as he headed to visit his girlfriend.', \"There's an entire long section in the post about Evelyn Hernandez, the young woman you're referring to.\", 'I was also like you at first. I saw a few documentaries and I was skeptical of the state\\'s case, so I read every book on the case and read some trial transcripts as well. \\n\\nI can address each one of these concerns. \\n\\n1. Scott saw Amber 5-6 times actually. And each time it was a mutli-day visit. Their first date was two nights together at a hotel, a fancy dinner at a Japanese restaurant, going to the park etc. \\n2. On Christmas Eve morning at 8:40- 8:44 to be exact someone looked up The Gap and looked at scarves, and there was a pop up for an umbrella stand. Then the person accessed Scott\\'s password protected email. That was even testified about at trial. \\n3. No one saw Laci walking the dog. All four who \"saw\" Laci were not called at trial because there stories were so off.  The people interviewed in the documentary The Murder of Laci Peterson were apparent “witnesses” who were never interviewed by the police and were not called at trial. Why? Because when Geragos interviewed them he found them to be unreliable, confused, or just wrong. **Homer Maldonado** claimed to have seen Laci walking the dog three times…during times she was proven to be elsewhere. Maldonado also refused to be interviewed by police or Scott\\'s attorney\\'s PIs. Because of this he was not called. **Vivian Mitchell** was another witness who claimed she saw Laci walking the dog on Dec. 24th. She then specified she knew exactly the time because she saw Laci during the football game on TV, but there were no football games on TV on the 24th. (Vivian had seen Laci on a different day.) Vivian was also 80 years old and her husband was 84. Her husband Bill told police he did not remember ever seeing Laci. **Mike Chiavetta** remembered seeing a woman walking a Golden Retriever in La Loma park on the most likely 24th but said that it was a bright sunny day and the park was filled with people. It was misty and overcast on the 24th although the 23rd was bright and sunny. Scott supporters will have you believe that Laci was abducted right after the Chiavetta sighting even though Chiavetta claims the park was filled with people that day. Also, Chiavetta never reported he saw Laci, he saw a woman in a white shirt walking a Golden Retriever. When asked if she was pregnant, he said “I don’t know.” **Tom Harshman** is the man who saw a pregnant woman pushed into a van on the 24th of December between 2 and 4 pm, however police documentation says this was not reported until the 28th. In between 2 and 4 pm, he saw a woman in a red shirt and black pants urinating against a fence. There was a man standing over her and she looked scared. Then he saw a hand reach out of a van and pull the woman into the van. The tip was not investigated by the Modesto police department because they circumstance, location, and clothing did not fit. So who saw Laci? Was It someone besides the four \"witnesses\" I profiled? I could not find any others in my research.\\n4. Scott most likely killed Laci by smothering. Where were the injuries? Scott had several small cuts on his hands that were noted at his interview on the 24th. Scott\\'s blood was also located on the comforter in his home (2 drops near the edge of the blanket), and on the drivers door of his truck. \\n5. As for Amber not being a good motive, I agree. I don\\'t think Amber was his motive. Scott\\'s motive was he was tired of hiding his 5 affairs and wanted to be a single playboy. Amber was not Scott\\'s only girlfriend, at trial it emerged that Scott had had at least 4 other affairs. One woman named Janet Ilse, he dated for nearly a year as a married man. There was also a \"health nut\" named Katy, and two others who went by nicknames at trial to protect their privacy. And these are just the ones we know about! \\n6. No one saw Scott\\'s empty boat.  The guy that did see someone that day could not indentify Scott except to saw he thought the guy was white or Hispanic. The other man who Geragos\\' PI claimed he found who \"saw\" Scott\\'s \"empty boat\" could not be found when the trial started by the prosecution OR the defense. \\n7. As for no one saw him load anything into the truck this isn\\'t exactly true. Karen Servas saw Scott load a bunch of five foot longish tarp wrapped things into his truck at approximately 9:40 am that morning. Scott said these were 4 patio umbrellas. The umbrella\\'s were in his truck all day, even at the Marina. he never took them out or stored them like he said he was going to. When they conducted a search warrant on the 26th, investigators found 4 tarp wrapped umbrellas in his truck bed as well as a 5th crumpled tarp. When investigators asked about it, Scott asked if they were going to bring cadaver dogs to his house. When the police decided to take the tarp with them a little later, Scott had spilled gasoline all over it. Cadavers dogs were unable to even sniff it.  \\n\\nUnfortunately, some documentaries still leave out all this information in order to paint Scott in a good light.', \"Multiple people? Like who? The A and E documentary talks to four people specifically. None of whom were called by the defense.  **Homer Maldonado** claimed to have seen Laci walking the dog three times…during times she was proven to be elsewhere.

You didn\\'t post about what your salary bump is going to be, that might be significant, the Peninsula is in general a little pricier than the Culver City area. As some others have mentioned, the \"North Peninsula\" is just as safe but more affordable and more diverse than areas south of San Mateo, but the weather\\'s usually colder. There aren\\'t a ton of Black people anywhere on the Peninsula, but there is the remnant of a community in East Palo Alto. My son (13) seems to do fine just mixing into the general polyglot mostly nonwhite mix of kids where we live (Pacifica), YMMV.

In the higher rent cities like Burlingame, San Carlos and Belmont, almost all the schools are good. In more urban cities like San Mateo and Redwood City, it really depends and some parents fight for magnet schools. \\n\\nThere are a number of new apartments that are built but I imagine rent is pricier. These exist along El Camino in San Carlos or downtown Redwood City. Downtown RC is walkable to a decent downtown (for the peninsula) though I’m not sure about the school district.

So, really, you’re going to have to pick what your trade off is. \\n\\nWhat might be possible is renting a small home (2 bed).

At your monthly budget of 3.7K, you’re mainly looking at older places, especially if you’re looking for 2Br+. Also, you may need to adjust some of your expectations. Crime on the peninsula generally isn’t too bad, so I wouldn’t worry about that, but most neighborhoods are pretty boring. You do get decent access to SF via Caltrain, though, which is nice. Schools are also pretty good - you’ll have to do more research on that, though. Also, if this matters to you, I generally don’t see many Black folks on the Peninsula. There is diversity, but it’s mostly Asian and some Hispanic. I think there are more Black people in the East Bay, and Berkeley has most of what you’re looking for in a neighborhood while also being cheaper than much of the peninsula, though living there would do a number on your commute. Finally, I hope you plan on having a car; public transit coverage is pretty spotty here.'], ['Hi I’m a Black woman in SF. I think your best options will be the south side of San Francisco and the cities directly neighboring to the south. Daly City, South San Francisco, San Bruno.

Bayview/Hunter’s point will as well, but crime is higher with greater income inequality. If you pick that area stay closer to 3rd st.

They will definitely see some things down there. \\n\\nI also lived in San Jose for a while. It would be a commute, but all of south bay is pretty safe. San Jose has a mini spread out Black community that you will see come out to support business, but in all of these areas you won’t see many Black people in the day to day. \\n\\nEast Bay: Try Oakland hills, Vallejo Hills (affordable + Black middle class), or Emeryville the commute would be a beast though, but there would be more Black people.'], ['All I can say is you were a 19-20 year old mom and now going to make 185k?

The middle schools can be a bit more hit and miss than elementary and high school though, so it might be a rougher transition than joining at a younger or older age, and I think you may miss out on having your kid get some quality high school experiences if you move back to LA before he graduates.\\n\\nSecond, it\\'s very apparent in the school district demographics, but pretty much anywhere in the area is only going to be around 1% black students. Racial makeup around here is often minority majority, but the minority groups are largely East Asian, South Asian, and Hispanic. So while the diversity helps promote a pretty inclusive environment and I\\'m sure your son will be accepted, you\\'re simply not going to have a lot of other black students or parents around. This will be the case anywhere in the Bay Area except far away places like Oakland... even East Palo Alto which was the historically blackest part of the Peninsula is only like 6% or so now in the local district.\\n\\nAs far as housing, you can find 2 bedroom apartments for $3.5-4k in the area but they\\'re going to be in older compelxes or small homes at that price point. I don\\'t know where you heard about rats in Palo Alto but that doesn\\'t sound right and any issues are going to be on a building by building basis. Definitely don\\'t sign a lease without a tour though! \\n\\nYou\\'ll likely need one car, but you can potentially live close enough to a school to let your son walk. There are a few pockets where middle and high schools can both be reached on foot, such as the Hillsdale and Aragon neighborhoods in San Mateo, the Carlmont neighborhood of Belmont / San Carlos, and central Millbrae on the more expensive end, or southern San Bruno on the less expensive side.\\n\\nThis region is not super exciting but it is very family friendly and close to \"interesting\" things like SF, the beach, etc. so you can still get out and do stuff when you want. There are plenty of youth activities, restaurants, outdoor activities, etc. in the immediate vicinity though so you may not need to venture out as much as other (probably younger and maybe childless) respondants say. \\n\\nFeel free to ask more specifics or DM me if you have other questions. And good luck on the decision!'], [\"There's very little crime on the Peninsula, so it's generally very safe. Outdated housing, yeah, that's pretty much everywhere here, landlords get away with charging luxury rates for apartments built in the 40s. As for stuff to do, you're within a half hour's drive of SF like 45 minutes of Oakland in San Mateo, so there's plenty of activities. \\n\\nDiversity... is going to be an issue on that side of the Bay. There are unfortunately very few Black people outside of some small communities in SF proper. Oakland has a ton, but then you're in the East Bay and you'd have to commute across a bridge for work.\"], [\"I've got bad news for you, the entire Bay Area is an Argentine ant colony.\"], ['I say stick with San Mateo/Burlingame. Commuting from the East bay on 92 is a huge pain in the ass.'], [\"This might be a large and unnecessary comment, but I hope I can provide a valuable perspective. I'm a San Jose native here, but have lived/worked up and down the peninsula and have a lot of close family in the city and San Mateo. \\n\\nI live with my partner, my mom, and brother, so my expenses are significantly lower, but my income is a little more than a quarter of your expected income.\\n\\nIn terms of stretching your cash, it's definitely doable. My mom raised my brother and i plus supported my grandma on her own since 2000 with a middling-to-upper 5 figure salary. She's retired recently and lives off her pension, plus the support of my brother and I. \\n\\nYes, the cost of living in the bay is noticeably higher than in LA, but with proper budgeting, you can definitely create a level of comfort at $185k. A lot of the folx here that paint a bleak picture of living here at $185k have valid takes because rent, utilities, gas, etc is expensive af here, but if you're not wildly spending cash going out every night, you're honestly going to be fine. If you need reccs on where to shop for cheaper, more affordable groceries and/or the best cheap (but bangin) eats, i gotchu.\\n\\nLike others have said, the peninsula is basically San Mateo County, which stretches between the SF border to Mountain View, and can generally be split in half with San Mateo serving as a halfway point. \\n\\nRents in the lower half, San Mateo -> Mountain View, are generally higher due to the proximity to Silicon Valley. Facebook, Google, Sony, Nintendo, and a slew of other mid size to large tech companies are located here. The weather is warmer and the diversity is questionable because it's mainly white folk, suburban east and south Asians, with everyone else sprinkled in. Tech bros are everywhere in the bay, but outside of the city, here is where you'll find a significant chunk of them. The school districts are great, academic-wise, but from what I remember from my friends back in the high school era (2010-2014), the social pressure is insane because a B average would put you in the bottom 30% of your peers. I've heard of a number of kids over the years unaliving themselves because of this. Not to scare you, but it's definitely something to think about when considering where to place your son for school. \\n\\nThe upper half of the peninsula (my personal preference if I had to live on the peninsula), rents vary a lot more because every town is different from the other. Burlingame (the norcal kkk chapter is located here), Millbrae, and Hillsborough are boujee af in comparison to Daly City, South City, and San Bruno. There's more diversity in the latter 3 towns than the former. Half moon bay and Pacifica are also located in the upper half, so you're fairly close to the beach ⛱️. I also find that there's more affordable food and grocery choices up here than the bottom half. The weather is a lot cooler, but you'll also find that the summers are a lot cloudier.\\n\\nFor fun, it really depends on what you're into, but you're never THAT far from things to do. San Mateo county has some GREAT hike and the beaches are close. If you need a Glendale shopping experience, you can drive 30-40 minutes to San Jose, where you can say it's a mini LA. If you need nightlife, there's clubs in SF and Oakland, as well as great bars sprinkled across little downtown areas throughout every town across the bay. You need a getaway? Go to wine country 1.5 hours away or go experience the mineral springs in Ukiah (2.5 - 3 hours north). Norcal has a lot to offer. \\n\\nI'm not sure what else to say unless you have specific points or questions I haven't addressed but I'm definitely open to providing more info about living here if you'd like !\"], [\"That's a good salary for a parent, but I think you should minimize your expectation on how much you will save in 3 years.

The middle schools can be a bit more hit and miss than elementary and high school though, so it might be a rougher transition than joining at a younger or older age, and I think you may miss out on having your kid get some quality high school experiences if you move back to LA before he graduates.\\n\\nSecond, it\\'s very apparent in the school district demographics, but pretty much anywhere in the area is only going to be around 1% black students. Racial makeup around here is often minority majority, but the minority groups are largely East Asian, South Asian, and Hispanic. So while the diversity helps promote a pretty inclusive environment and I\\'m sure your son will be accepted, you\\'re simply not going to have a lot of other black students or parents around. This will be the case anywhere in the Bay Area except far away places like Oakland... even East Palo Alto which was the historically blackest part of the Peninsula is only like 6% or so now in the local district.\\n\\nAs far as housing, you can find 2 bedroom apartments for $3.5-4k in the area but they\\'re going to be in older compelxes or small homes at that price point. I don\\'t know where you heard about rats in Palo Alto but that doesn\\'t sound right and any issues are going to be on a building by building basis. Definitely don\\'t sign a lease without a tour though! \\n\\nYou\\'ll likely need one car, but you can potentially live close enough to a school to let your son walk. There are a few pockets where middle and high schools can both be reached on foot, such as the Hillsdale and Aragon neighborhoods in San Mateo, the Carlmont neighborhood of Belmont / San Carlos, and central Millbrae on the more expensive end, or southern San Bruno on the less expensive side.\\n\\nThis region is not super exciting but it is very family friendly and close to \"interesting\" things like SF, the beach, etc. so you can still get out and do stuff when you want. There are plenty of youth activities, restaurants, outdoor activities, etc. in the immediate vicinity though so you may not need to venture out as much as other (probably younger and maybe childless) respondants say. \\n\\nFeel free to ask more specifics or DM me if you have other questions. And good luck on the decision!', \"There's very little crime on the Peninsula, so it's generally very safe.

Facebook, Google, Sony, Nintendo, and a slew of other mid size to large tech companies are located here. The weather is warmer and the diversity is questionable because it's mainly white folk, suburban east and south Asians, with everyone else sprinkled in. Tech bros are everywhere in the bay, but outside of the city, here is where you'll find a significant chunk of them. The school districts are great, academic-wise, but from what I remember from my friends back in the high school era (2010-2014), the social pressure is insane because a B average would put you in the bottom 30% of your peers. I've heard of a number of kids over the years unaliving themselves because of this. Not to scare you, but it's definitely something to think about when considering where to place your son for school. \\n\\nThe upper half of the peninsula (my personal preference if I had to live on the peninsula), rents vary a lot more because every town is different from the other. Burlingame (the norcal kkk chapter is located here), Millbrae, and Hillsborough are boujee af in comparison to Daly City, South City, and San Bruno. There's more diversity in the latter 3 towns than the former. Half moon bay and Pacifica are also located in the upper half, so you're fairly close to the beach ⛱️. I also find that there's more affordable food and grocery choices up here than the bottom half. The weather is a lot cooler, but you'll also find that the summers are a lot cloudier.\\n\\nFor fun, it really depends on what you're into, but you're never THAT far from things to do. San Mateo county has some GREAT hike and the beaches are close. If you need a Glendale shopping experience, you can drive 30-40 minutes to San Jose, where you can say it's a mini LA. If you need nightlife, there's clubs in SF and Oakland, as well as great bars sprinkled across little downtown areas throughout every town across the bay. You need a getaway? Go to wine country 1.5 hours away or go experience the mineral springs in Ukiah (2.5 - 3 hours north).

That makes it very hard for a child to focus during the day and be successful in school.', 'From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness: \"a home is not just a physical space: it also provides roots, identity, security, a sense of belonging and a place of emotional wellbeing.\"\\n\\nThe definition used here may not be what /you/ think of as homeless, but it is a valid, and common definition.', 'EPA is not PA. It\\'s a different city. It is not just the \"east part\" of PA like when people say East San Jose. \\n\\nWith that said, EPA is known for being cheap, ghetto, poor, high crime rates, and gang activity. It\\'s the complete opposite from Palo Alto. \\n\\nIt also is probably one of the cheapest parts of the bay area, and definitely the cheapest on the peninsula. \\n\\nEPA is however experiencing gentrification and will not be cheap much longer.', \"they already leased for a very cheap price, $1200 / month. If they move to Sacramento, the rent would be the same. I think they don't have enough money to move, they are trapped there.\", \"You've got to remember though that East Palo Alto is very different to Palo Alto itself. It's one of the cheaper areas in this region and there are a lot of fairly rundown houses there.\", \"Where the fuck do some of you people find such high prices? Are you only looking at luxury apartments? Thirty seconds on craigslist shows that you're off by quite a bit.\\n\\nThere are plenty of one-beds in the $2000-2500 range, even less, in SF. Plenty in the $1500-2200 range in the south bay. If you're paying $3k in SJ, that's called a luxury apartment. You don't need it, it's not the going rate for everyone.\", 'San Jose/WG area.  That was a couple years ago though.  My parents sold their tiny house for 1.5 mil too after a bidding war.  They had paid 200k for it back in the 80s lol', 'LMAO your rich kids are the ones with the rampant xanax and opiate problems. You also have a problem with suicides to the point that there has to be a security guard at each crossing. \\n\\nThere are WAY bigger problems in PA than poor kids going to school there...\\n\\nsource - grew up in Menlo Park. Half of my graduating class is dead/in rehab/killing themselves with their parents money and lack of effort or just doing absolute nothing while flexing on IG...', \"Yeah, that's the real problem here. Not enough tranquility in Palo.\", \"Maybe if you didn't put so much pressure on your precious Palo Alto children, and if you didn't instill in them that being unable to afford living in palo alto was the worst thing possible, that you don't deserve anything except to disappear if you aren't rich and successful, and that poor people are, as you so eloquently put it, *an infestation*, you wouldn't have such a persistent problem with your little snowflakes running to go take a train to the face after class because they literally cannot stand your attitude any more.\", \"I'd be interested in learning what your background is and how you developed this opinion.\\nThough I strongly disagree with your position, I think you stated it pretty clearly, and you're entitled to your opinion.\", \"wtf, you're just suggesting to make things worse for the EPA kids. Why don't you think of something that helps the less fortunate?\\n\\nI get it, you're worried about your own family and you should be. However, if we help the less fortunate everyone wins.\", 'I think we are facing a shift in America where what was \"normal\" now is so different than what was \"normal\" in the past that many of our systems are making assumptions based on lagging perceptions of reality.\\n\\nin 1950 or even 1980, sharing a living space with people you aren\\'t related to was considered something you did when young and single and starting out. Living in a multi-generational space or a multi-family space was something that immigrants just starting out did, to save money and receive comfort from a familiar community at home.\\n\\nMy understanding is that the home configurations that we consider \"normal\" now in the Bay Area, because of the insane cost of housing, would be evidence of severe problems when viewed thru the lens of 1980 - it was a lot more affordable to live on your own back then, so needing to move your family into another family\\'s garage was a sign of SEVERE trouble. \\n\\nHowever, today, you could have two working parents with good savings and college funds for their kids living in very creative housing, because housing is so blown out relative to the cost of everything else that they can afford all the trappings of a middle class existence......but not housing. in 1950, a family huddling in your garage because they literally couldn\\'t afford to rent an apartment would absolutely be considered homeless by society at large- they are so poor they can\\'t get housing and have to crash with you and pay a pittance to sleep in the room you built to store your car. They would be at the mercy of kind-hearted people willing to open their homes, or creative people willing to pool resources and cram together someplace never intended to house multiple families.\\n\\nYou don\\'t consider these people homeless because your perceptions are shaped by the same housing costs that they are subject to - you KNOW objectively that people working hard at full-time jobs with kids are severely squeezed\\n\\nmethinks the definition of homelessness used here was one based on prior conceptions of what \"secure housing\" looked like to a \"normal\" person. It is only recently that it\\'s normal to say \"i don\\'t know anyone that can afford to live independently in SF\" (and honestly i don\\'t believe you, you must know someone subject to rent control or someone making lots of money but renting the smallest place because they could afford it. but i get your broader point.) \\n\\nBefore the recession, even most deadbeats could move out of their parents\\' home. that shifted, perhaps permanently, after the recession and more people live at home after college because it\\'s not so easy to just get a job and move out.  Despite that being a prudent choice, there are still lots of boomer parents out there whose perceptions lag behind, who call their kids deadbeats for struggling to get that first entry level job because dad got one and moved out no problem when he graduated in 1969, etc. This is like that - what you describe didn\\'t use to be normal, even if it\\'s normal now.', 'I\\'m not sure that a $1000 RV you got from a junkyard without heat, shower or fridge and parked on land your don\\'t own or rent counts as \"a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence\", and it\\'s certainly a long way from your rented apartment.', \"This has been an issue so close to me. I grew up in Korea and, even to this day, Korea as a society cannot even recognize this as a problem. Korea has consistently topped world suicide rate, higher than counties in the grips of civil wars.\\n\\nIt's appalling to me that the same thing happens and it's treated the same here, with complete apathy and disinterest. It's almost as if there is a gag order on this that people aren't allowed to talk about. \\n\\nCan you give us some insight in circumstances? Despite similarities in epidemiology, Korea and the silicon valley are very different places. I would like to understand what really is happening here.\", 'Their profile is just posts on CS:GO.. I am at a loss.', 'I agree 100%. It seems that everyone around my age (recently graduated) expects all the luxuries their parents worked 15+ years for... and often took on debt for (eg, nice cars, nice house).', \"It is happening all over the country in very rich areas. Namely the fact that parents expect their children to be able to live where they do. \\n\\nBuying a house in Palo Alto is not something that even the children of the wealthy can afford. If they mess up in school or life in general, the idea of ending it all seems less painful than subjecting themselves to failure or a lower standered of living. \\n\\nNot to mention that many kids in PA have immigrant parents with VERY high expectations. It's a recipe for disaster which we have seen with the numerous suicides in San Mateo County.\", 'If children are sleeping on couches, floors, or in the case of my families, horse stalls, camp grounds, or in cars .... all are substandard.  If you are renting a couch or a bunkbed in SF, that is your choice, you can chose to move elsewhere.  These families do not have a choice, I hope you understand that.']",
