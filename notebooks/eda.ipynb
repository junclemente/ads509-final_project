         "[[\"Quote from another comment on this topic from a year ago:\\n > Zhong went to Gunn High School, an affluent top-performing school in Palo Alto, which is filled with high achieving kids, many of them will follow their parents's footsteps into tech jobs, and they're all vying for spots at many of the same top schools. Such high achieving classmates put Zhong about top 9% in a class of 485, and his high SAT score was likely not singular at Gunn, which means there might had been as many as 40 people at his high school with better academic numbers than him vying for spots at the same schools he was shooting for. High selective colleges in general, and highly competitive programs like computer science, don't want to have a bunch of kids from one particular high school in their freshman classes. So realistically there may have been one or two opportunities for Gunn Class of '23 grads who wanted to major in computer science at any one of the schools Zhong applied to, and there were other Gunn graduates more competitive than him.\\n\\n> Much has been made of young Stanley Zhong's big differentiator of founding a startup, how amazing it is for a teenager to do that. Stanley's father, Nan Zhong, is a Software Engineering Manager at Google. Previously he co-founded two startups, created the #1 ranked communication app on Android (featured by Fortune and Amazing Android Apps for Dummies), and raised $10M in venture funding. Before that, he led the team that built AWS's Elastic Load Balancing service. The Varsity Blues admissions scandal looms large in the minds of admissions officers at highly selective schools. If I were an admissions counselor with Zhong's application in front of me, the startup founder claim would pop, and a healthy skepticism of such a remarkable claim would have me doing some googling where I would find his father's profile, and immediately be suspicious about how much this startup was actually Stanley's doing vs his father's, to be honest.\\n\\nTotally get his frustrations, but with this context, there's a very reasonable possibility that there was a reason what happened to him happened.\\n\\nAlso, note that he ended up at Texas U&M, which is still a stellar school.

Going from ‘I have impressive accomplishments but didn’t get in’ to ‘it was racial discrimination’ is a logical leap. I had some similar stats when I applied to undergrad and got rejected from most places I applied to (even after spending months on my essays). The number of nationwide high school valedictorians per year is far greater than the number of spots per year in many colleges — and that’s just the valedictorians, let alone everyone else with impressive accomplishments.\\n\\nA while ago a Yale admissions officer stated on a podcast something that’s stuck with me: **deciding who to admit to a selective college is not about who ‘deserves it’ the most or even who is the ‘best’. It’s about selecting a cohort of people for a very specific four-year experience.** No amount of accomplishments can definitively put someone into that cohort. If there actually was racial discrimination, this point is moot, but I’m just saying that pointing out one’s accomplishments is irrelevant.'], ['He only got into UT and U Maryland, what’re the odds he just had atrocious applications?'], ['Racial discrimination…?

I do not believe in only using test scores as testing is also very flawed (and wealthier applicants will be incentived to just cheat to get higher test scores, which many already do) - testing is also not non-discriminatory and many studies have shown that testing has bias. Majority of applicants to UC’s have similar applications - they will outright reject an application that has a PIQ response that doesn’t answer the question and thought it was funny to say something silly or give a one sentence response.

If yes, then they are qualified.  The only correction factor needed is to offset for income disparity, not race, ethnicity, legacy, donor, etc.  Why is this?   We know the wealthy have greater access to educational resources.  This is a result of unequal financing of elementary and high schools based on property taxes, resulting in unequal spending and unequal treatment, a fundamental violation of democratic principles.  In short, those who are qualified based on adjusted criteria, should then be admitted by simple random draw.  This is the only fair and equitable way.

         "[\"Quote from another comment on this topic from a year ago:\\n > Zhong went to Gunn High School, an affluent top-performing school in Palo Alto, which is filled with high achieving kids, many of them will follow their parents's footsteps into tech jobs, and they're all vying for spots at many of the same top schools. Such high achieving classmates put Zhong about top 9% in a class of 485, and his high SAT score was likely not singular at Gunn, which means there might had been as many as 40 people at his high school with better academic numbers than him vying for spots at the same schools he was shooting for. High selective colleges in general, and highly competitive programs like computer science, don't want to have a bunch of kids from one particular high school in their freshman classes. So realistically there may have been one or two opportunities for Gunn Class of '23 grads who wanted to major in computer science at any one of the schools Zhong applied to, and there were other Gunn graduates more competitive than him.\\n\\n> Much has been made of young Stanley Zhong's big differentiator of founding a startup, how amazing it is for a teenager to do that. Stanley's father, Nan Zhong, is a Software Engineering Manager at Google. Previously he co-founded two startups, created the #1 ranked communication app on Android (featured by Fortune and Amazing Android Apps for Dummies), and raised $10M in venture funding. Before that, he led the team that built AWS's Elastic Load Balancing service. The Varsity Blues admissions scandal looms large in the minds of admissions officers at highly selective schools. If I were an admissions counselor with Zhong's application in front of me, the startup founder claim would pop, and a healthy skepticism of such a remarkable claim would have me doing some googling where I would find his father's profile, and immediately be suspicious about how much this startup was actually Stanley's doing vs his father's, to be honest.\\n\\nTotally get his frustrations, but with this context, there's a very reasonable possibility that there was a reason what happened to him happened.\\n\\nAlso, note that he ended up at Texas U&M, which is still a stellar school.
